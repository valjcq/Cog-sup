money-fx	INDUSTRIAL NATIONS RECONVENE FOR TALKS .  Financial ministers and central bankers of leading industrial nations reconvened here this afternoon.     Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson said on entering the meeting the ministers would review the Paris agreement. Asked if he was satisfied with West German and Japanese stimulus, Wilson replied, "They could do a little more."     French Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, meanwhile, confirmed there would be a communique at the end of the meeting.     Finance ministers and central bankers of Britain, FRance, Canada and West Germany were seen by Reuter correspondents returning to a Treasury building.     Japanese officials and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl did not appear to have left the building at the end of earlier Group of Five talks which broke up around 2 p.m. local time (1800 gmt).     There was no sign, however, of the Italian delegation whose position was thrown into question this morning by the resignation of the Christian Democratic wing of Italy's Socialist-led government.     European monetary officials said later that the Italian delegation was inside the building.     This meant that a full blown meeting of the Group of Seven was in progress.  Reuter &#3;
livestock,carcass	U.S. MEAT, POULTRY INSPECTION CALLED FAULTY .  The U.S. meat and poultry inspection programs are incapable of protecting consumers from contaminated products, groups representing inspectors and consumers charged.     "The whole trend of inspection for the last 10 years has been to corrupt and to degrade the system where today the public is at constant risk to contaminated and adulterated meat," Kenneth Blaylock, president of the American Federation of Government Employees, told a House Agriculture subcommittee.     "The American consumer has little reason to feel confident about the safety of meat and poultry being offered to him today," said Rodney Leonard, executive director of the Community Nutrition Institute.     "Company management is less concerned about the risk to health than about raising plant output and company profits," Leonard told a hearing of the House Agriculture Subcommittee on Livestock, Dairy and Poultry.     Kenneth Morrison, staff associate at the Government Accountability Project, said inspectors consistently disclose violations of federal law, demonstrating a "serious breakdown in the entire inspection system."     Morrison told of chicken fat for flavoring being contaminated by "intestines dragging in a water trough used to flush away the condemned product, fecal material, human spit, chewing gum and paper towels used by plant employees to blow their noses."     Donald Houston, administrator of the U.S. Agriculture Department's Food Safety and Inspection Service, FSIS, defended the government's program, calling it "one of the most respected public health programs in the world."     FSIS inspects an estimated 127 mln head of cattle and 4.5 billion chicken and turkeys every year.     Houston said inspection programs have kept pace with change, but conceded that the danger of chemical residues in the meat and poultry supply has increased.     He also said that, although he was confident the bacterium salmonella eventually could be eradicated, it would take time and much money to contain the growing problem.     Salmonella, which in extreme cases can cause death, is found in approximately 37 pct of U.S. broilers, 12 pct of raw pork and three to five pct of raw beef, Houston said.     The number of reported cases has doubled over the past 20 years, he said, to 40,000 cases annually.     "We certainly really have not found an effective means of turning this disease around," said Rep. James Olin (D-Va.)     The National Research Council recommended in 1985 that FSIS intensify efforts to develop rapid diagnostic procedures for detecting microoganisms.     But the meat and poultry industries have said such controls would cost too much.     "Hopefully we will not overreact by installing unnecessarily complicated procedures that may become obstacles to the real goal of providing an increasingly safer, more nutritious and economical meat supply for consumers," Stanley Emerling, executive vice president of the National Association of Meat Purveyors, said.     Blaylock, speaking on behalf of food inspectors, said a new program allowing elimination of USDA inspection functions at certain plants "voids the law in letter and spirit, and must be repealed or we will see rising consumer fraud and an epidemic of death and illness for which there will be no prevention nor legal recourse."     Subcommittee Chairman Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) said the panel would hold a hearing on salmonella June 2.  Reuter &#3;
acq	CHRYSLER &lt;C> RENAULT DELAY AM MOTORS &lt;AMO> PACT .  Chrysler Corp and Regie Natiionale des Usines Renault said they agreed to extend by up to two weeks the period for reaching definitive agreement on Chrysler's proposed 1.5 billion dlr takeover of American Motors Corp.     The letter of intent signed by Chrysler and Renault on March nine set April nine as the target date for completing negotiations.     However, the letter also allowed room for an extension of that date to April 23 if an agreement could not be reached.     The two companies said they "now plan to complete work by April 23."     Chrysler and Renault said, "Given the complex nature of the deal, the need for additional time was to be expected."     The March letter of intent between the two companies says that Chrysler could ask Renault to extend the agreement date "in the event that prior to April 9, 1987, Chrysler discovers an unforeseen problem in the course of its 'due diligence' investigation of the company," referring to American Motors.     A Chrysler spokeswoman would not say whether some problem had cropped up in the talks. She stuck by the company's statement that more time was needed because the talks are complex. "That is our definition of the delay," she said.     Under the previous agreement between Chrysler and Renault, their letter of intent would be terminated on April nine or when an agreement was reached. But the letter could be amendend by a written agreement by both companies.     The Chrysler spokeswoman said, "We are still working toward a definitive agreement." Said another Chrysler official who is not part of the talks but who would be told if the deal were in trouble: "There are no glitches."     Analysts also downplayed the significance of the delay. "I can't visualize where they wouldn't want it to be done," said Donaldson Lufkin Jenrette analyst Richard Henderson.  Reuter &#3;

General Electric Corp said its first quarter results were significantly higher due to the strong results of RCA, which was acquired last year.     General Electric also attibuted continued strong performances in plastics, major appliances and the Employers Reinsurance Corp for its strong quarter.     GE recorded net earnings for the first quarter 1987 of 624 mln dlrs, or 1.37 dls per shr, up 16 pct from 537 mln dlrs, or 1.18 dlrs per share for the same quarter a year ago.     General Electric chairman John Welch Jr reiterated the company's outlook for 1987 in which it expects double-digit GE earnings growth for the year. He said the first quarter results are in line with those expectations.     General Electric cited the strong results in TV network and station operations of the National Broadcasting Co, which was not part of GE in the first quarter of 1986, as one reason for its strong earnings.     It also noted that aircraft engine operating profit was much higher than a year ago, caused by a increase in shipments than the 1986 quarter, which was impacted by a strike.     Aerospace revenues were sharply higher in this year's first quarter from a year ago, mainly because of the inclusion of RCA's aerospace and defense business, the company said.     In addition, consumer products revenues were up from last year, mainly because of including sales of RCA video products.     General Electric said restructuring provisions of 308 mln dlrs before taxes to implement various strategic moves were charged against operations in the first quarter of 1987. It added that there was a one-time gain of 281 mlns dlrs after taxes from an inventory accounting change.     And technical products revenues and operating profit were ahead of last year, led by a strong increases in medical systems volume and the inclusion this year of RCA's communications and related services.

COPPER VENTURE .  &lt;Teck Corp> said it was continuing talks about joining a joint copper venture at Highland Valley, British Columbia, held by affiliates Cominco Ltd &lt;CLT> and &lt;Lornex Mining Corp>, but did not know when negotiations would be completed.     Teck vice-president of administration John Guminski said in reply to a query that the talks had been "ongoing for a long time." He declined to speculate on the outcome.     Cominco, 29.5 pct owned by a consortium led by Teck, is optimistic that the talks will soon be concluded, spokesman Don Townson told Reuters.     "I think all partners are hopeful that the situation will be resolved," Cominco's Townson said.     "We're optimistic that they will be concluded shortly," he added. Townson declined to specify when the talks might end.     Cominco and Teck's 22 pct-owned Lornex agreed in January 1986 to form the joint venture, merging their Highland Valley copper operations.     Cominco and Lornex share equally in control and management of the Highland Valley operations, while Cominco has a 55 pct share of production and Lornex receives 45 pct.     For the six months following July 1, 1986, when the venture officially started production, Highland Valley had total ore milled of 22.6 mln short tons, grading an average of 0.41 pct copper, Townson said.     Cominco's share of production was 43,000 short tons of copper contained in concentrate, 1,200 short tons of Molybdenum in concentrate, 340,000 ounces of silver and 800 ounces of gold, he said.

Xebec said IBM has historically accounted for about 50 pct of the company's revenues, but that total fell to 20 pct during the quarter just ended.     IBM had used Xebec's hard disk drive controller products in the IBM PC/XT, a product which IBM is phasing out.     Xebec said it intends to continue streamlining its operations in light of the loss of business.

South Korea's purchase of about 2.4 mln tonnes of U.S. corn in the past six months -- close to double last year's total -- indicates that imports from the United States, as well as total imports are set for a dramatic jump, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     In its World Production and Trade Report, the department said total South Korea corn imports for the 1986/87 season (Oct-Sept) are estimated at 4.3 mln tonnes, with about 3.4 mln tonnes from the United States.     During the 1985/86 season, imports totaled only 1.3 mln tonnes of U.S. corn out of a total of 3.6 mln tonnes.     Ite appears the Koreans are shifting back to U.S. corn in light of competitive U.S. prices and uncertain supplies from China, Argentina and South Africa, it said.  Reuter &#3;

The requirement is not expected to affect the number of Mexican steers imported into the United States and the brand will be applied before the animals arrive at U.S. ports of entry.

The Federal Reserve will promote lower interest rates this year to sustain world economic growth, First Boston Corp managing director Albert Wojnilower said.     As much as the Fed would like to take a tough line against inflation, it cannot act to slow the growth of credit without subverting national U.S. economic policy.     "On selected occasions when the dollar seems steady, and, because the trade deficit is not responding, the United States decided to push Germany and Japan harder to meet their commitments to economic growth, the Federal Reserve will do its part by moving rates down," Wojnilower said in a report.     "Justifiably not anticipating either a recession or seriously higher interest rates, securities market participants have seen little to fear," Wojnilower said.     He said last week's "hiccup" in money and currency rates and bond and stock prices was probably caused by Japanese window dressing for March 31 end-of-fiscal-year accounts.     Wojnilower said the U.S. probably enjoyed above-average economic growth in the first quarter.

"To help maintain our open access to the U.S. steel market, the government is taking further action to ensure we have more accurate data on exports and imports and that Canada is not used as a backdoor to the U.S. market by offshore suppliers," Carney said.     Carney also said Canadian companies were being asked to exercise prudence in the U.S. market and both countries were considering establishing a joint commission to study the growing steel problem.

Canadian steel shipments to the U.S. have risen to 5.7 pct cent of the U.S. market in recent months, almost double the level just two years ago, Canadian trade officials said.     The increase in Canadian shipments comes at a time of growing anger in the U.S. over rising steel imports from several countries in the face of a decline in the domestic steel industry.

earn	WILLIAMS &lt;WMB> SEES FLAT PIPELINE VOLUMES IN 1987 .  Williams Cos said it expected oil and fertilizer transportation volumes to be flat in 1987 but said operating profits from the pipeline unit should improve from 49.4 mln dlrs earned last year when a seven mln dlr special charge was incurred.     Williams Pipeline Co took the charge against earnings in 1986 for the removal of more than 500 miles of old pipeline from service and for casualty losses. Companywide, Williams had a net loss of 134 mln dlrs on total revenues of 1.85 billion dlrs, a decline from profits of 32 mln dlrs on sales of 2.46 billion in 1985.     In its annual report, Williams said its Northwest Pipeline Corp and Williams Natural Gas Co had natural gas costs that are among the lowest in the nation, averaging 2.04 dlrs and 2.07 dlrs per mcf, respectively, last year. Total natural gas reserves for both units declined to 10,010 billion cubic feet in 1986 from 11,334 billion cubic feet the previous year.     The company said its Williams Natural Gas unit, which has less take-or-pay exposure than most major pipelines, should show improvement in its 1987 operating results because of changes tariff and federal tax rates.     The company's gas marketing business is expected to have somewhat lower earnings in 1987 because of competition in its operating region, the annual report said. The gas marketing unit earned 26.0 mln dlrs on sales of 285.6 mln dlrs last year.     Williams also said it expected a substantial decline in its debt to equity ratio this year because of more than 250 mln dlrs received in cash from the sale of Agrico Chemical Co and proceeds from the sale and leaseback of Williams Telecommunications Co. The telecommunications business, a 2,000-mile fiber optic system for long distance use, will not be profitable until late 1988, Williams said.  Reuter &#3;

"...there are conditions which may indicate that the company will be unable to continue as a going concern," auditors Deloitte Haskins and Sells said in Hawkeye's annual report to shareholders.     Hawkeye reported a 1986 loss of almost 59 mln dlrs, citing an increase in its loan loss provision to 34.7 mln dlrs and restructuring costs of 27 mln dlrs.     However, Hawkeye, with assets of 1.09 billion dlrs at 1986 year end, said it expects "to have sufficient cash to meet its obligations for the next 12-month period."     Last July the bank holding company reached a debt restructuring agreement which identifed 17 bank subsidiaries and five non-bank operations for disposition.     "The restructuring has improved Hawkeye's financial condition, but it does not assure that Hawkeye will be able to survive as a going concern," the report said.     Hawkeye's survival will depend on its ability to comply with provisions of the debt restructuring and regulatory agreements and on its ability to return to profitable operations, it said.

As previously reported, Dome is seeking approval in principle for the debt restructuring plan. Dome said in the filing it proposed lenders sign a letter of understanding in early April, with implementation to be effective July 1, 1987.     Dome Petroleum reiterated in the SEC filing that its existence as a going concern is dependent on continuing the interim debt plan, due to expire on June 30, and winning agreement for its proposed restructuring plan.

trade	DEFICIT CUTS SEEN UNABLE TO CURE TRADE DEFICIT .  Financial analysts say they are pleased with congressional moves to trim next year's federal budget deficit but believe the actions will do little to help improve the U.S. trade deficit or buoy the economy.     The House of Representatives is expected to vote tomorrow to approve a trillion-dollar budget blueprint for the coming fiscal year that reduces the deficit by 38 billion dlrs.     Similarly, the Senate Budget Committee has approved a plan that would cut federal red ink by about 37 billion dlrs next year.         "In terms of the economy, 37-38 billion dlrs is infinitesimal, so cuts of this magnitude will have little impact on the economy and the trade deficit," said Stanley Collander, a Touche Ross federal budget policy analyst.     "At best, it will have a small positive effect," Collander said in an interview.     Federal Reserve Board Chairman Paul Volcker has repeatedly told Congress that cutting federal red ink would go a long way to help reduce the massive trade deficit and also help ease some of the downward pressure on the value of the dollar.     The U.S. government has attempted to remedy the trade imbalance by driving down the value of the dollar. But Volcker has warned that a further fall in the dollar's value is fraught with danger.     Such a decline, he has said, could refuel inflation as imported goods become more expensive and chase away foreign capital needed to finance the federal budget deficit.     In addition, in February, U.S. officials meeting with other major industrialized nations in Paris agreed that the value of the dollar had dropped enough and that world exchange rates should be stabilized at around current levels.     As part of that agreement, Japan and West Germany agreed to take steps to stimulate their economies and the United States agreed to cut its budget deficit.     The alternative to driving down the dollar any further as a way to deal with the trade deficit, Volcker said recently, is to reduce U.S. consumption, particularly federal spending.     "If you don't deal with the budget deficit, everything else you do is going to be counterproductive," Volcker said in recent testimony before the Senate Banking Committee.     Volcker also said he would prefer to further tighten the government's purse strings than have the Fed tighten the credit supply if action was needed to fight inflationary pressures or to assure the continued flow of foreign capital into the United States.     Analysts say that Fed tightening now could choke off the current modest economic expansion and threaten a recession.     Kemper Financial Services economist John Silvia stressed that any deficit reduction was better than none.     But he said the size of the cuts under consideration were  not enough to give the Federal Reserve Board the flexibility it needs to steer the economy or to keep the value of the dollar from plunging further in world exchange markets.     "There's no doubt that some deficit reduction helps, but if your objective is to stabilize the dollar and perserve the Fed's flexibility to conduct monetary policy, then the answer is, it's not enough," Silvia told Reuters.     The U.S. trade deficit has become one of the government's most vexing and persistent problems.     The 1986 deficit was 169.8 billion dlrs and there is as yet little indication that this year's figure will be any lower, though administration officials have predicted it will drop by about 20 to 30 billion dlrs by year's end.     In the past, Volcker has joked that he never lost sleep worrying whether Congress would cut too much fat from the federal budget.     On the other hand, he also has made it clear he is not attached to the gradually declining deficit ceilings set for the 1986-1991 period by last year's Gramm-Rudman balanced budget law.     While the new law set a ceiling of 108 billion dlrs for next year's federal deficit, both the House and Senate Budget Committees have conceded that their budget plans would fall short of the deficit reduction goal by about 25 billion dlrs.     "For political reasons, 35 to 40 billion dlrs is about the most you're going to get" out of Congress at the present time, said Touche Ross's Collander. "To do something more than that would be extraordinary, remarkable and very, very difficult."     Collander said the real danger for Congress was to end up short of the deficit reduction goal set by its Budget panels.     "To an extent, this has become the minimum acceptable reduction level," he explained. "Anything less than that will now look like a failure to Wall Street."     The budget plan now under debate on the House floor would lower an estimated 171 billion dlr deficit for the year beginning on October one to about 133 billion dlrs by cutting defense and domestic programs by 38 billion dlrs from their anticipated spending levels for next year.     The Senate Budget Committee has called for a deficit of nearly 134 billion dlrs with about 18.5 billion dlrs in new  taxes and about the same amount in spending cuts.  Reuter &#3;

American Brands Inc's 545 mln dlrs acquisition of National Distillers and Chemical Corp's liquor business is expected to be one of a series of acquisitions by the tobacco company, analysts said.      "They were very frustrated with their inability to get Chesebrough. They said they were looking for an acquisition. It doesn't surprise me that they came up with another one," said Allan Kaplan of Merrill Lynch and Co.     American Brands failed late last year in its 2.9 billion dlrs bid for Chesebrough-Ponds Inc when Unilever N.V. agreed to buy the company. But since then, Wall Street has been speculating that American Brands would find another candidate to help reduce its earnings exposure to tobacco.     "This is just typical," said George Thompson of Prudential-Bache securities. "There's going to be more to come here. American Brands had to make an acquisition because tobacco is still a significant part of earnings. Their position is a little less favorable than Philip Morris and RJ Reynolds," he said. cash flow from its low growth tobacco, but the tobacco business does require great amounts of capital expenditures. It can therefore use its funds to make acquisitions. Analysts said the National Distillers' spirits company, which makes Gilbey's gin and vodka, Old Grandad and Old Crow whiskey, is not quite the type of acquisition they envisioned.     "The distilled spirits business has been in a steady gradual decline for sometime, as has the tobacco business," said Thompson.  REUTER... &#3;
interest,money-fx	BUNDESBANK CALLS FOR CENTRAL BANK COOPERATION .  Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler called on central banks of major industrialised nations to cooperate closely on exchange and interest rate policies.     In a lecture at the University of Surrey, pre-released here, Koehler said that the only alternative to cooperation was protectionism and control on capital movements.     "Central banks have sufficient experience of exchange market transactions to steer exchange rates where they want to have them," he said. He added that West German growth forecasts would have to be revised downward because of the recent dollar drop to 1.80 marks from above two marks at the start of 1987.     Koehler said that transactions on foreign exchange markets had parted company with transactions in goods, services and investments. It was the scale of speculative transactions that determined market trends.     Speculative inflows could cause monetary aggregates to grow. To reverse such a rise in the money stock, interest rates would have to be lowered to allow funds to drain off.     "In other words, the monetary policy measures required are different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to -- those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of mounting economic activity," Koehler said.     The dollar fall was one means of reducing the massive U.S. Current account deficit. But attempts to keep the depreciation going by talking the dollar down posed problems.     The sharp drop of the dollar had led to an immediate steep rise in the cost of U.S. Imports and a sharp fall in the cost of European imports. But the volume effect of falling imports to the U.S. And rising imports to Europe would take time to make itself felt compared with the price effect.     "Hence the depreciation of the dollar may well be going further than would be necessary to adjust the current account over the medium term," Koehler said.     A reduction in the U.S. Current account deficit would occur only if the growth rate of GNP was higher than domestic demand. In Japan and West Germany by contrast, domestic demand should rise faster than GNP.     "In Germany this did indeed happen in 1986," Koehler said.     If a further appreciation of the dollar was to be prevented, the U.S. Current account deficit could be offset by an inflow of foreign funds into the U.S..     But only if there was an appropriate interest rate differential would Europe and Japan look for financial investment in the U.S.     When selecting monetary policy instruments, a central bank had to pay greater heed than in the past to the impact its measures might have on expectations and consequent decisions.     Koehler said the Bundesbank was changing money market rates by operating on the open market rather than adjusting leading interest rates because of the signal this gives to the market and its substantial impact on exchange rates.     It was not only important to achieve the domestic goals of price stability, economic growth and full employment but also to tackle international problems like the exchange rate problem, the debt problem and the current account problem.     A strategy had to be designed that helped "the safeguarding of non-inflationary economic growth in an international monetary system largely free of disruptions," Koehler said.     Given the system of floating exchange rates, it was necessary for central banks to agree to intervene. It sufficed to tell the market where central banks saw exchange rates over the next few years and intervention points should not be set, because they were only testing points for the market, he said.     In order to keep the international monetary system free of disruptions central banks should not only intervene jointly but also cooperate on interest rate policies, Koehler said.  REUTER &#3;

The two are due to visit Japan later this month for farm talks.     The U.S. Has been pressing Japan to discuss the rice issue at the new round of General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade talks. But Japan has said GATT is not the right forum.     Imports of rice to Japan are banned under the Foodstuff Control Act.

acq,trade	ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - TELECOM IS KEY JAPAN MINISTRY .  Japan's little-known Ministry of Posts and Telecommunications (MPT) has emerged as an international force to be reckoned with, political analysts said.     MPT, thrust into the spotlight by trade rows with the U.S. And Britain, is in a position of strength due to its control of a lucrative industry and its ties with important politicians, they said.     "The ministry is standing athwart the regulatory control of a key industrial sector, telecommunications and information," said one diplomatic source.     "They are a potent political force," the diplomatic source said.     But MPT is finding domestic political prowess does not always help when it comes to trade friction diplomacy, analysts said.     "The ministry was a minor ministry and its people were not so internationalized," said Waseda University professor Mitsuru Uchida. "Suddenly they're standing at the centre of the world community and in that sense, they're at a loss (as to) how to face the situation."     Most recently the ministry has been embroiled in a row with London over efforts by Britain's Cable and Wireless Plc to keep a major stake in one of two consortia trying to compete in Japan's lucrative overseas telephone business.     The ministry has favoured the merger of the two rival groups, arguing the market cannot support more than one competitor to Kokusai Denshin Denwa Co Ltd, which now monopolizes the business.     It has also opposed a major management role in the planned merger for any non-Japanese overseas telecommunications firm on the grounds that no such international precedent exists.     The ministry's stance has outraged both London, which has threatened to retaliate, and Washington, which says the merger plan is evidence of Japan's failure to honour pledges to open its telecommunications market.     Washington is also angry over other ministry moves which it says have limited access for U.S. Firms to Japan's car telephone and satellite communications market.     Much of MPT's new prominence stems from the growth of the sector it regulates.     "What has been happening is an important shift in the economy which makes the ministry a very important place," said James Abegglen, head of the consulting firm Asia Advisory Service Inc.     A decision to open the telecommunications industry to competition under a new set of laws passed in 1985 has boosted rather than lessened MPT's authority, analysts said.     "With the legal framework eased, they became the de facto legal framework," said Bache Securities (Japan) analyst Darrell Whitten.     Close links with the powerful political faction of the ruling Liberal Democratic Party (LDP) nurtured by former Prime Minister Kakuei Tanaka are another key to MPT's influence, the analysts said.     "Other factions ignored MPT (in the 1970s), but the Tanaka faction was forward looking and ... Recognized the importance of MPT," Uchida said. Many former bureaucrats became members of the influential political group, he added.     The ministry also has power in the financial sector due to the more than 100,000 billion yen worth of deposits in the Postal Savings System, analysts said.     MPT has helped block Finance Ministry plans to deregulate interest rates on small deposits, a key element in financial liberalisation, since the change would remove the Postal Savings System's ability to offer slightly higher rates than banks, they said.     Diplomatic sources, frustrated with what they see as MPT's obstructionist and protectionist posture, have characterized the ministry as feudal.     Critics charge MPT with protecting its own turf, limiting competition and sheltering the former monopolies under its wing. Providing consumers with the best service at the lowest price takes a back seat to such considerations, they said.     But many of the ministry's actions are not unlike those of its bureaucratic counterparts in much of the Western world including Britain, several analysts said.     "The United States is really the odd man out," Abegglen said. "For a government to take the view that it wants to keep order in utilities markets is not an unusual and/or unreasonable view," he said.  REUTER &#3;
trade,money-fx	G-7 ISSUES STATEMENT AFTER MEETING .  Following is the text of a statement by the Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- issued after a Washington meeting yesterday.     1. The finance ministers and central bank governors of seven major industrial countries met today.     They continued the process of multilateral surveillance of their economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthened economic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 Tokyo summit of their heads of state or government.     The managing director of the International Monetary Fund also participated in the meeting.     2. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting, and noted the progress achieved in implementing the undertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement.     They agreed, however, that further actions will be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain global economic expansion, and reduce trade imbalances.     In this connection they welcomed the proposals just announced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japan for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan's economy through early implementation of a large supplementary budget exceeding those of previous years, as well as unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.     The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to further open up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services.     3. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.     In that connection they welcomed the strong implementation of the Louvre Agreement.     They concluded that present and prospective progress in implementing the policy undertakings at the Louvre and in this statement provided a basis for continuing close cooperation to foster the stability of exchange rates.

interest	GERMAN BANKERS' REMARKS REVIVE TALK OF RATE CUT .  Remarks by two leading central bankers sparked renewed speculation in financial markets that a cut in the West German three pct discount rate may be under discussion, currency dealers said.     Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler said in a speech that monetary growth resulting from speculative capital inflows required cuts in interest rates.     Separately, West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss told journalists that the discount rate could fall below its lowest ever point of 2.75 pct. He made clear that he was not making a forecast on interest rates, however.     Currency dealers here and in the Far East said the dollar gained slight background support from the speculation.     But German dealers noted that the Bundesbank kept the 3.80 pct rate unchanged at which it offered liquidity to the money market this week, dashing some expectations that it may either offer lower fixed rate money or offer a reduced minimum rate and let the strength of banks' demands set the allocation rate.     It allocated 6.1 billion marks in new liquidity, much less than the 14.9 billion leaving the market as a prior pact expired. This further weakened sentiment the Bundesbank could move to a more accommodative monetary stance, dealers said.     Koehler said in a speech in Surrey, England, speculative capital inflows may cause monetary growth, regardless of whether central banks intervened or exchange rates fell.     "In other words, the monetary policy measures required are different from -- and sometimes diametrically opposed to -- those needed when the money stock is increasing as a result of mounting economic activity."     Though Koehler was known to be the most liberal of the generally monetarist Bundesbank board, his comments marked the first time cuts in rates had been concretely suggested as a counterpoint to overly strong monetary growth, dealers said.

The Soviet trade deficit with the West almost quadrupled last year, reaching 2.72 billion roubles compared with 713 mln in 1985, official figures showed.     Statistics published by the monthly journal Foreign Trade showed Soviet trade turnover for 1986 fell to 130.9 billion roubles from 142.1 billion the previous year, a drop of 7.8 pct.     Moscow's trade surplus with East Bloc countries continued to grow in 1986.     Western analysts attributed the deficit rise with the West to the world oil price slump, which hit Moscow's main export and cut hard currency earnings needed for purchases in the West.  REUTER &#3;

Pretax profits also dipped to 601.7 mln stg after 614.4 mln.

sugar	EC SUGAR TENDER SEEN MARKING NO CHANGE IN POLICY .  The maximum export rebate granted at yesterday's EC sugar tender marked no change in policy over producer complaints that they are not obtaining the EC intervention price in exporting sugar outside the Community, EC Commission sources said.     The maximum rebate was 46.496 Ecus per 100 kilos for 118,350 tonnes of sugar, down from 46.864 Ecus the previous week, but the change is explained by world market conditions.     Producers claim the rebate was short of the level needed to obtain a price equivalent to the intervention price by over one Ecu per 100 kilos, and was 0.87 Ecu short the previous week, the sources said.     They said this was despite the fact that the Commission had to accept 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention from operators protesting that rebates are too low.     Operators have now until early May to withdraw this sugar. But they have not given any sign of planned withdrawals unless the Commission reviews its export policy, they said.  REUTER &#3;

Lazo said the stock split would reduce the par value of the company's common stock from 10 to five pesos.     He said the stock split would apply to holders of about 18 mln common shares of stock on the record date of September 15 1987. "The exercise should make our stock more marketable," Lazo said. "Now it is beyond the reach of many small investors."     PLDT common stock surged from a low of 37 pesos in February 1986 to 367.50 at close of trading yesterday on the Manila Stock Exchange.     Lazo said the 20 pct stock dividend, payable on October 15, would also apply to stockholders on record as of September 15.     PLDT reported 1986 net income of 1.89 billion pesos, up 68 pct from 778.9 mln pesos in 1985, on operating revenues of six billion pesos, up from 4.7 billion pesos in 1985.     At end December 1986 the company had 417,100 stockholders.     A PLDT spokesman said the company's profits are likely to be substantial since the government raised its franchise tax to three pct from two and to impose a 35 pct corporate income tax from which it was previously exempt.     The government has not so far ordered the implementation of the tax decision.     PLDT is the largest of 58 telephone companies in the Philippines.

The Netherlands' largest insurer Nationale Nederlanden NV &lt;NTTN.AS> (NatNed) said it expected at least unchanged results in 1987 after reporting 1986 net profits up 5.3 pct to 635.5 mln guilders from 603.4 mln in 1985,     Revenues increased by 0.5 pct to 17.35 billion guilders after 17.27 billion the previous year, and the dividend was raised to 2.50 guilders per share from 2.38 guilders in 1985, corrected on a capital increase.     The company said guilder revenue and profit were pressured by falls in exchange rates, particularly in the US and Australian dollar and sterling.     Without these currency fluctuations, net profit would have been 30.7 mln guilders higher and revenue 1.97 billion higher, NatNed said.     The international share in turnover was 50 pct in 1986 compared with 52 pct in 1985.     The company's life insurance result fell to 365.7 mln guilders after 428.4 mln in 1985 due to currency influences, tighter interest margins and increased investment.     Claim payouts fell to 9.9 mln guilders after 66.6 mln the previous year.     The company's total assets reached 69.87 billion guilders in 1986 against 67 billion the year before.     Assets per share equalled 65.68 guilders against 65.53.     Without these currency fluctuations, net profit would have been 30.7 mln guilders higher and revenue 1.97 billion higher, NatNed said.

dlr,money-fx	EUROPEAN MARKETS REACT QUIETLY TO G-7 COMMUNIQUE .  European currency markets reacted quietly to the G-7 communique, with comments from bankers and dealers ranging from disappointment that it was not more concrete to surprise that the markets should have expected so much.     The dollar opened lower against virtually all currencies and traded in a narrow range after the communique, which reaffirmed support for the Paris accord on currency stabilisation but contained no moves to strengthen it.     Dealers in Frankfurt and Zurich saw the dollar remaining broadly entrenched in its current trading range.     "The dollar is likely to stay within a range of 1.80 to 1.84 marks," said Gisela Steinhaeuser, senior dealer at Chase Bank AG. She said there was some resistance to further climbs.     However, she said the dollar could break out of the range with major surprises such as a worse-than-expected U.S. Merchandise trade deficit, due next Tuesday.     Theodor Stadelmann, dealer with Bank Julius Baer and Co Ltd in Zurich, said he expects the dollar to hold steady against the mark and Swiss franc but to weaken further against the yen, possibly to 140 yen.     A Milan banker shared Stadelmann's view, saying he expects a dollar-yen range of 140-150 in the short term.     London traders said the G-7 communique failed to curb underlying bearishness toward the dollar but this negative sentiment was not yet strong enough to tempt interbank operators to test the downside.     Concern that finance ministers and officials still in Washington could issue more concrete statements in favour of currency stabilisation kept players sidelined, along with worries about provoking fresh central bank intervention in the near term, the traders said.     Most Paris dealers expressed disappointment at the communique, saying nothing has changed to reverse the dollar's downward trend.     Traders in several centres said the market would look for fresh opportunities to test the willingness of central banks to defend current ranges, which the communique said were "broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."     Dave Jouhin, senior dealer at Midland Bank in London, said "They're going to put somebody's resolve to the test soon." The U.S. February trade data may provide the trigger, dealers said.     However, some dealers said London-based operators would be unlikely to open major positions next week ahead of the long Easter weekend. They saw near-term technical support at 1.825 marks and 145 yen and resistance about 1.83 marks and 146 yen.     Chase Bank's Steinhaeuser and other Frankfurt dealers said the G-7 communique guaranteed a relatively calm and stable market for the foreseeable future compared with the extreme volatility seen in the first few months of this year.     One dealer at a German bank said the wording of the communique made clear the leading nations did not want a further dollar drop, and this was supporting the dollar.     The German dealer saw the dollar gradually appreciating to 1.87 marks, broadly seen as its upper limit within the Louvre accord's supposed currency target range.     A Swiss bank economist said he believed the markets were ready for a period of "mainly sideways movement."     But Milan dealers were sceptical about the communique contributing to greater stability.     "Nothing has changed substantially to give the dollar a big boost," said one dealer, while another Italian banker said he expects the dollar to trade between 1.77 and 1.87 German marks in the next three months.     A Swiss monetary source, who asked not to be named, said the communique had been in line with realistic expectations and should not have produced disappointment.     "The problem is that the changes needed in fiscal and trade policies to redress current imbalances are of a different timescale than currency markets operate on," the source told Reuters, "This is a political process which takes time."     Alois Schwietert, chief economist at Swiss Bank Corp in Basle, also questioned the tone of disappointment evident on currency markets today. "Did people really expect a patent remedy?" he asked.     Bank economists in Paris noted yesterday's meeting was only the first in a series and said the market would watch carefully in the next few weeks for any changes in positions.     A senior economist with Banque Indosuez said the focus was now on trade and growth rather than interest rates. Any move by Japan and West Germany to boost their economic growth could lead to a quick change in the U.S. Position.     Dealers in all centres agreed that markets would be wary in pushing the dollar too far too quickly in the coming months while central banks appear resolved to use their muscle to support the Paris accord.

money-fx,interest	GERMAN MONEY MARKET SPLIT ON LOWER RATE PROSPECTS .  Remarks by central bankers raised some hopes the Bundesbank will cut rates on securities repurchase pacts, but operators remained divided on the likelihood of a move in the near term, money market dealers said.     Comments by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler yesterday that rate cuts were needed to curb money supply growth from speculative capital inflows, and by West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss that there was no natural lower limit to the discount rate had, however, no immediate impact.     Call money declined to 3.65/75 pct from 3.75/85 pct but the drop was tied to extra liquidity in the market, dealers said.     Dealers said the Bundesbank's latest liquidity allotment this week dashed some hopes of lower rates.     The Bundesbank allotted only 6.1 billion marks yesterday in new liquidity in a repurchase pact at an unchanged rate of 3.80 pct, thus subtracting some 8.8 billion marks from the market, as an outgoing 14.9 billion pact expired.     But some dealers said the smaller volume awarded by the pact was in line with present liquid money market conditions, and did not exlude a cut in the repurchase pact rate soon to 3.70 pct if money market rates continue at present levels.     The next opportunity for the Bundesbank to lower rates on repurchase pacts will be in a tender expected next Tuesday.     Bundesbank officials have already said they favour more discreet rate adjustments through repurchase pacts, rather than the more public adjustment of leading rates.     The Bundesbank may either set a fixed allocation rate and allow banks to tender for the volume, as has been the case since it lowered its discount rate January 22, or else it may allow banks to tender for the rate and set the volume itself.     Dealers expect volume of the tender to be lower than the 15.2 billion marks flowing out, to offset other incoming funds.     Some seven billion marks is expected to flow in next week. This should then flow back into the market as it is deposited with banks.     Banks were well supplied with liquidity, holding 61.5 billion marks in reserves at the Bundesbank on Tuesday.     Holdings of average daily reserves over the first seven days of April stood at 59.6 billion marks, still above the estimated 51 billion required for all of April.  REUTER &#3;

The European Community launched an investigation into allegations of dumping by Japanese semiconductor makers in a move which diplomats said could mark an intensification of world trade strains.     Tokyo already faces a deadline of April 17 from Washington for the imposition of 300 mln dlrs worth of tariffs on chips it imports into the U.S.     The EC Executive Commission said today the European Electrical Component Manufacturers Association complained that Japanese firms were selling high capacity EPROM type (erasable programmable read only memory) chips at unfairly low prices.     Japan last year took 78 pct of the 170 mln dlr EC EPROM market, up from 60 pct in 1984. The EC firms said they had been forced to offer their products at a discount of up to 30 pct in order to compete with the Japanese.     The Commission said it believed the Association had given sufficient elements of proof for dumping to warrant an investigation, which could lead it to impose duties if it found the complaints were justified.     The Commission claims last year's accord between the U.S. And Japan on microchip pricing gives U.S. Firms privileged access to the Japanese market.  REUTER &#3;

money-fx	FINANCE MINISTERS AGREE ON NEED FOR STABILITY .  Finance ministers from seven major industrialized nations agreed on the need to stabilize currencies at current levels but said more action was needed to reduce trade imbalances and sustain economic growth.     In a communique issued after a four-hour meeting at the U.S. Treasury that ended last night, the ministers said the value of the dollar and other currencies was basically correct now, and they welcomed new measures planned by the Japanese to boost their economy.     West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg called it a "good meeting" and in brief remarks exchanged with reporters other ministers seemed pleased with its outcome.     Shortly after the communique was issued and just as foreign exchange trading opened in Tokyo, the Bank of Japan intervened again to prevent the yen rising too quickly.     The communique said, "The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting. They agreed, however, that further actions will be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain global economic expansion and reduce trade imbalances."     It welcomed the plans set this week by the Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party to stimulate its economy with what the communique termed "extraordinary and urgent measures" including an "unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures."     The meeting of the so-called Group of Seven brought together ministers and central bank governors of the seven major industrial democracies, the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada.     The communique said the ministers reaffirmed the commitment on cooperation reached in a meeting on February 22 in Paris when they had agreed to stabilize foreign exchange rates at the then-current levels.     In the weeks that followed, the dollar continued to fall against the Japanese yen despite massive dollar purchases by the Bank of Japan and other central banks and is now trading at around postwar lows.     Japan has come under growing criticism from both the United States and European countries for its only modest efforts to open its markets to outside competition and to reduce its exports.     The communique said Japan affirmed its intention to open domestic markets to foreign goods and services but did not elaborate.     It said the officials "reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting."

earn	AEGON EXPECTS MODERATE RISE IN 1987 PROFITS .  Dutch insurer AEGON NV &lt;AEGN.AS> reported a 6.4 pct increase in 1986 net profits to 327.1 mln guilders and said it expected a moderate increase in profits for 1987.     Total revenue was eight pct lower in 1986 at 7.97 billion guilders vs 8.7 billion guilders in 1985. The company said its revenues were down due to lower foreign exchange rates and a change in accounting practice. It added that revenues would have risen by about seven pct had those changes not occurred.     Revenue from Dutch operations rose five pct in 1986, mainly due to its life insurance business.     Health insurance revenues in the Netherlands also rose despite a notable shift to insurances with lower premiums and higher personal risks.     Damage insurances made losses, mainly due to car damage insurances. AEGON did not specify the loss.     In the United States, revenue in guilders from health and life insurance was lower. AEGON said this was due to a change in accounting for U.S. Annuities.     AEGON said annuities are subject to such strong personal investment influences that it should be accounted differently from the more traditional insurances.     This change in accounting practice and another change to account for profits made on fixed interest investments, resulted in an incidental rise in net profits of 31 mln guilders.     AEGON said incidental negative influences on net profits were slightly higher, being the lower dollar rate, high initial costs for new products, and the cost of new headquarters in The Hague.     In 1986, a large number of new insurance products emerged in the Netherlands and the U.S., AEGON said. Large initial costs for these products have depressed net profits somewhat.     Monumental Corp, a U.S. Insurer which merged with AEGON in May 1986, saw its profits almost completely eroded by these costs and made only a small contribution to the group's profits.     AEGON said it has written-off 657 mln guilders in goodwill for Monumental Corp.     AEGON's net equity was 2.71 billion guilders in December 1986, against 3.46 billion the year before.   REUTER &#3;
trade,money-fx	G-7 ISSUES STATEMENT AFTER MEETING .  Following is the text of a statement by the Group of Seven -- the U.S., Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- issued after a Washington meeting yesterday.     1. The finance ministers and central bank governors of seven major industrial countries met today.     They continued the process of multilateral surveillance of their economies pursuant to the arrangements for strengthened economic policy coordination agreed at the 1986 Tokyo summit of their heads of state or government.     The managing director of the International Monetary Fund also participated in the meeting.     2. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the commitment to the cooperative approach agreed at the recent Paris meeting, and noted the progress achieved in implementing the undertakings embodied in the Louvre Agreement.     They agreed, however, that further actions will be essential to resist rising protectionist pressures, sustain global economic expansion, and reduce trade imbalances.     In this connection they welcomed the proposals just announced by the governing Liberal Democratic Party in Japan for extraordinary and urgent measures to stimulate Japan's economy through early implementation of a large supplementary budget exceeding those of previous years, as well as unprecedented front-end loading of public works expenditures.     The government of Japan reaffirmed its intention to further open up its domestic markets to foreign goods and services.     3. The ministers and governors reaffirmed the view that around current levels their currencies are within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and the basic policy intentions outlined at the Louvre meeting.     In that connection they welcomed the strong implementation of the Louvre Agreement.     They concluded that present and prospective progress in implementing the policy undertakings at the Louvre and in this statement provided a basis for continuing close cooperation to foster the stability of exchange rates.

money-fx	G-7 WANTS TO SHOW MARKETS ITS RESOLVE - MIYAZAWA .  Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the Group of Seven (G-7) countries reaffirmed their Paris accord on stabilising currencies to convince the market of their resolve.     At a news conference after today's G-7 meeting, Miyazawa said the ministers and central bank governors did not believe a totally new statement was needed.     The speculative selling did not reflect economic fundamentals, and since the fundamentals had not changed only a reaffirmation of the goals of the Paris accord was needed, he said.     He also noted that this test of the G-7 nations resolve had concentrated on the yen, while other currencies, especially the mark, had remained stable.     Miyazawa said any change in economic conditions since the Paris accord was not worth being called fundamental.     "As I said at a time of Louvre (agreement), the expression of 'current level' is rather vague idea," he said.     The yen's movement in the past several weeks is within the range agreed in Paris in Febraury, he said.     It was better to give a vague expression than pin-pointing a level, which could have an adverse impact on the market, Miyazawa said.     Asked why only Japan was committed to fresh measures in the statement, he said Japan was exceptional among the seven because the yen appreciated against the dollar while other major currencies largely have been stable.     He also said Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party has justed adoped a package to reflate the economy while other nations are not supposed to produce new measures in a short period since the Paris agreement.     Miyazawa also said the U.S. sanctions against Japanese semiconductor products was not discussed through the G-7 meeting and did not affect the currency talks.     The seven nations discussed the debt problems of developing countries and ways to proceed in line with the debt initiative outlined by U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker 18 months ago.  REUTER &#3;
yen	YEN SEEN RISING AFTER G-7 COMMUNIQUE .  The yen is likely to start another uneven rise against the dollar and other major currencies because the Group of Seven communique contained nothing new, currency and bond analysts here said.     "Is that it? I was expecting something more than that," said one trader at a major Wall Street securities company.     Marc Cohen of Republic National Bank of New York said: "The market now has the impetus to drive the dollar lower again."     The dollar hovered between 145.50 and 147 yen in the days just before the talks. Dealers restrained their underlying bearishness and squared positions ahead of Wednesday's meeting of the finance ministers and central bankers of the top seven industrialized nations in Washington.     After more than four hours of talks, the G-7 issued a communique which merely reaffirmed the recent Paris agreement's view that prevailing currency levels were broadly consistent with economic fundamentals and that exchange rate stability should be fostered around these levels.     The dollar sank to 144.75 yen in early Tokyo trading.     "They said that the dollar/yen rate was broadly in line with fundamentals when it was 154. Now they are saying it's in line when it's at 146. Will this still be so at 138 or 130?," asked Republic's Cohen.     Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa fuelled speculation about the amount of fluctuation the authorities are prepared to tolerate by saying that the current yen level is still inside the range agreed on in Paris in late February.     Official statements in recent weeks had indicated that the key psychological level of 150 yen was at the lower end of the authorities' permissible range.     Dealers and analysts warned that the dollar's decline would probably be uneven. They anticipated a concerted effort to prop up the dollar and restrain the yen via a mixture of open market intervention and public comments.     Shortly after the Tokyo market opened today the Bank of Japan was detected by local dealers buying moderate amounts of dollars. The dollar rebounded to about 145.20 yen.     The sources said the market may also be wary of agressively selling dollars for yen before Tuesday's February U.S. Trade data. The figures are expected to show a deficit of 13 billion dlrs, from a provisional 14.8 billion in January.     &#3;
yen	JAPAN BUSINESS LEADERS SAY G-7 ACCORD IS WORRYING .  The leaders of two of Japan's top business groups said in separate statements the Group of Seven (G-7) accord reached in Washington yesterday is of deep concern to Japan because it shows the major industrial nations regard the yen's current level as appropriate.     Eishiro Saito, chairman of the Federation of Economic Organizations (Keidanren), said the yen's present rate is well above adequate levels. He did not elaborate.     Takashi Ishihara, chairman of the Japan Committee for Economic Development, said the accord will not prevent the yen from rising further.     "We do not understand why the G-7 approved present rates as the yen has risen excessively since the Paris accord," Ishihara said.     G-7 members Britain, Canada, France, Italy, Japan, the U.S. And West Germany said in a statement they consider their currencies are now within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals.     Saito called on each G-7 member nation to prepare to intervene in the market strongly enough to ensure exchange rates are stabilised at appropriate levels.  REUTER &#3;

FAO said in its monthly food outlook bulletin total world grain output was expected to fall 38 mln tonnes to 1,353 mln in 1987, due mainly to unusually high winter losses in the Soviet Union, drought in China and reduced plantings in North America.     World cereal stocks at the end of 1986/87 were forecast to rise 47 mln tonnes to a record 452 mln tonnes, softening the impact of reduced production. But stocks are unevenly distributed, with about 50 pct held by the U.S.     "Thus the food security prospects in 1987/88 for many developing countries, particularly in Africa, depend crucially on the outcome of this year's harvests," FAO said.     FAO said world cereal supplies in 1986/87 were estimated at a record 2,113 mln tonnes, about five pct higher than last season and due mainly to large stocks and a record 1986 harvest, estimated at 1,865 mln tonnes.     FAO's forecast of 1986/87 world cereals trade was revised upwards by eight mln tonnes to 179 mln due to the likelihood of substantial buying by China and the Soviet Union.  REUTER &#3;

The company said the loss followed four quarters of modest profits. In the year ago quarter it earned 11,000 dlrs, or one cent a share. For the first half of fiscal 1987, it reported a profit of 42,000 dlrs, or two cts a share, compared to a year earlier loss of 294,000 dlrs, or 17 cts a share.     It said President Michael R. Hall will assume the duties of chief executive officer.     Physio Technology said the resignation of Chairman James C. Lane can constitute non-compliance with its Series A convertible subordinated debentures due 1996 and a default under its agreement with the Merchants Bank of Kansas City.     It explained a declaration of non-compliance under the debentures would create a a default under the loan agreements requiring immediate payment of 1.8 mln dlrs of debentures and about 450,000 dlrs outstanding under the bank credit line.     The company said the debenture holders intend to waive the non-compliance, but reserve the right to withdraw the waiver at the end of any 30 day period.

The Bundesbank sees no current reason to change monetary course, vice-president Helmut Schlesinger told Reuters in a telephone interview.     Schlesinger was responding to questions following remarks yesterday by Bundesbank board member Claus Koehler and West Berlin state central bank president Dieter Hiss, which, dealers said, revived some speculation that German interest rate cuts may once again be under discussion.     Schlesinger said he had no comment on the remarks of his two central bank council colleagues.     But he added that the last central bank council meeting on April 2 had discussed the economic situation with a mood of "subdued optimism," particularly influenced by the news brought by several state central bank presidents.     "Much is going better than the impression gained by the public from the January figures, which have been in the meantime superseded," he said.     German January industrial output fell 3.0 pct after a decline of 0.9 pct in December. New industry orders fell 1.9 pct after they had been unchanged in December.     Bank economists said that the two together showed the economy would either stagnate or contract in the first quarter of 1987.     Aside from the economic developments, Schlesinger added, a steady monetary course was important to hold the dollar/mark rate around current levels as Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl had said while attending the Washington World Bank/IMF meeting.     Asked, however, if the Bundesbank could move to cut rates on repurchase agreements at the setting of the next repurchase tender, due next Tuesday, Schlesinger said, "Since the central bank council gives its opinion on this theme only every 14 days, this is hardly probable."     Responding to the question whether the Bundesbank had moved away from a policy of targetting monetary growth toward one of targetting currency rates, Schlesinger said he could have no comment on the subject while negotiations were still in progress in Washington.

dlr,yen	U.S. SAID TO VIEW G-7 MEETING AS MAJOR SUCCESS .  The United States, which has long sought Japanese action to stimulate its economy, appears to be satisfied Tokyo's latest package is a major development and allows leading industrial nations to reaffirm their agreement to stabilize currencies.     Monetary sources said they believed that U.S. Treasury Secretary James Baker considered Tokyo's package, announced yesterday, to be a major stimulation of the Japanese economy.     But yesterday's statement by seven leading industrial powers endorses the yen's rise from around 153 to the dollar, the level at the February 22 Paris Accord, to about 145 today.     And the initial reaction of currency markets in the Far East demonstrates that financial markets are unconvinced that currencies yet reflect economic fundamentals, even though the countries appear to do so. The yen sank below 145 at one point despite intervention by the Bank of Japan.     Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's Finance Minister, said the movement since Paris was consistent with currency trading ranges the nations agreed to defend in the February talks.     "I would say that what has happened (to the yen) in the past several weeks was not outside the range we agreed to in the discussions in Paris," Miyazawa said yesterday.     The supplementary budget worth about 34.48 billion dlrs was announced by the ruling Liberal Democratic Party on the eve of Miyazawa's departure for Washington, to attend yesterday's meetings of leading industrial nations.     In a strongly worded statement terming the Japanese action "extraordinary and urgent", the meeting reaffirmed the Paris Accord by noting that current exchange rates are within ranges broadly consistent with fundamentals, or economic reality.     The Group of Seven -- the United States, Japan, West Germany, France, Britain, Italy and Canada -- therefore repeated their willingness to continue close cooperation to foster exchange rate stability.     The cooperation agreement has resulted in concerted central bank intervention of 8 billion to 9 billion dlrs to halt the dollar's fall. While relatively unsuccessful, the scale of intervention between so many nations is unprecedented in recent years. Monetary sources also said they understood that Secretary Baker considered the meeting to be extremely successful in the light of the Japanese announcement.     They also said there was a growing feeling among the finance ministers and central bankers that cooperation over medium-term policies has replaced the bickering over short-term differences in past meetings.     West Germany, whose currency has not risen anything like the yen since the Paris Agreement, appears from the face of yesterday's statement to have won acceptance from other countries that its exchange rate is acceptable.     Bonn's finance minister Gerhard Stoltenberg argues that major currency shifts needed to remedy the huge imbalance between West Germany and Japan's trade surpluses and America's trade deficit have already taken place.     No mention was made, however, of the U.S. commitment to cut the budget deficit even though it is implied in the reafffirmation of Paris.     European nations and Japan believe deficit cuts are essential to curbing the record U.S. trade shortfall that reached nearly 170 billion dlrs last year.     A similar argument was made on Capitol Hill earlier this week by Federal Reserve Board chairman Paul Volcker. A further sharp fall to redress trade imbalances would "clearly pose substantial risks of renewed inflationary momentum and could undermine confidence in future financial stability," he said.     Volcker warned a further dollar fall might force the politically independent Fed to drive up interest rates.     Monetary sources said that, privately, West Germany welcomed the rise in the yen against the dollar while its own currency remained relatively stable against the U.S. unit.     Bonn and other European nations worry that once the weak dollar blunts Tokyo's export drive to the United States, the Japanese monolith will concentrate on European markets.     The ministers, meanwhile, also continued talks on making their policy coordination more binding and one, Canadian Finance Minister Michael Wilson, said good progress was made.     Wilson said they will meet before the June Economic Summit to prepare a report for the leaders of the seven nations.     The United States and France, backed by the International Monetary Fund, want the seven to agree on ranges or "norms" for a limited number of economic objectives such as growth, inflation, monetary conditions, trade balances and current account balances.     Sharp deviations from these guidelines would result in consultations between the countries on whether corrective action should be required.     But the inclusion of currencies as one of the objectives has Bonn and London worried, monetary sources say, because it implies Washington is moving in the direction of target zones.     The sources said the Reagan administration unsuccessfully sounded out its allies on a system of target zones to limit currency fluctuations just before the February meeting.     The concept is a much more rigid one than the secret ranges of the Paris Accord and would mark a sharp departure from the relatively free currency markets of recent years.  Reuter &#3;

gnp	GLOBAL ECONOMIC SLOWDOWN RAISES NEW DEBT FEARS .  The global economy is expected to weaken this year, adding new worries to an already serious poverty outlook, economic analysts said.     For finance ministers and central bankers attending this week's semi-annual meetings of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, the new figures released by the IMF add an additional concern.     The Fund estimated world output would only grow by 2.7 pct this year, versus 2.9 pct last year, and 3.1 pct in 1985.     In the industrial countries, Gross National Product, a measure of all goods and services, was expected to decline to 2.3 pct this year, compared with 2.4 pct in 1986, the IMF said.     For the developing countries, the Gross Domestic Product, another measure of economic growth, was expected to fall to 3.0 pct from 3.5 pct last year.     The new figures are considered a major disappointment to the poorest countries. They had hoped that new vitality in the industrial countries brought on by a sharp decline in oil prices would assist their economic recovery and help them cope with growing mounds of debt.     IMF officials, discussing their outlook, said they believed the industrial country economies would move up to an annual growth rate of three pct by the end of the decade.     Economic analysts and the IMF have been saying for some time that the ability to keep the debt crisis from turning into an economic rout rests on sustained economic growth.     Since the debtor countries must look to the wealthier states for markets for their products as well as financial assistance, economic weakness in the developed nations'  economies poses fundamental worries.     Debtor countries, including the very poorest states, have only a few avenues open to them for earning foreign exchange, including the key one of exports.     The U.S. economy, which is in its fifth year of expansion, has served as a mainstay for developing country exports, but it too is seen as being rather feeble this year, growing by only 2.3 pct, according to the IMF.     For this reason and because of a high trade deficit, the United States has been pressuring Japan and West Germany to ignite their economies but with little apparent success.     The IMF study also examines the course of the dollar and the curious lack of impact it has had on the U.S. trade deficit.     Reagan administration officials have been saying that the impact is now beginning to show up, although it has been much slower than expected.     The IMF observed in its World Economic Outlook that "it has to be recognized that exchange rate adjustments take time to work through to payments flows -- probably at least three years to get a resonably complete effect."     The report added, however, "the adjustments may take even more time on this occasion." REUTER^M &#3;

The government's perceived need to control inflation by keeping a tight rein on credit was unnecessary, he said.     High real interest rates were attracting an influx of speculative foreign capital which was undercutting the government's target for monetary growth, Cuevas said.     Spain's most closely-watched measure of money supply, liquid assets in public hands, grew at an annualised rate of 17 pct in March, against 11.4 pct in December last year and a target range of 6.5 to 9.5 pct for 1987.     To combat this, the Bank of Spain has raised its call money rate 14 times so far this year, to 14.5 pct at present from 11.8 at end-1986.     Cuevas said employers were heeding the government's call to hold wage increases to its five pct inflation target this year, with increases from salary reviews awarded last year and new wage pacts averaging 5.6 pct in the first quarter of 1987.     These agreements covered less than 40 pct of Spanish workers, Cuevas said, with the rest still in wage negotiations.     He said Spain's current wave of strikes mainly affected the state sector, where the government is trying to impose its five pct wage ceiling.     Cuevas said employers were also worried about the trend in Spain's foreign trade balance. The trade deficit in the first two months of 1987 totalled 233 billion pesetas, a 68 pct increase over the corresponding period last year.     However, employers did not favour a devaluation of the peseta to correct the imbalance.  REUTER &#3;

lead	LEAD PRICES RISE ON FINELY BALANCED PHYSICALS .  Lead prices have risen this week against a background of a finely balanced physical sector, traders said.     Further gains are possible if the USSR steps up its buying or if labour problems develop in North America, they added.     London Metal Exchange (LME) prices are unusually buoyant at a time of year when seasonal demand is normally slackening and prices tending to drift lower.     This buoyancy is generally attributed by traders to the low level of LME stocks and steady, if unspectacular, physical demand in the Northern Hemisphere finding supplies curtailed.     The supply problems are not new but are beginning to be felt by a market in which, as peak winter demand tails off, stocks usually build fast and availability increases, traders said.     The lower supply levels result from a number of different factors around the globe.     Delayed shipments from Peru to Mediterranean countries because of production and transport problems, lack of Spanish exports since the closure last year of Cia La Cruz's smelter at Linares and lower output in Morocco and Greece have all meant additional demand being directed to merchants who in turn have been drawing on LME stocks.     In addition Broken Hill Associated Smelters' Port Pirie, South Australia, smelter is halting production for five weeks for maintenance. Although the company said it would meet commitments, this will put further pressure on stocks.     And the U.S. Company Doe Run has kept its 140,000 tonnes per year Boss, Montana smelter closed. This cut producer stocks and contributed to a closer supply/demand balance within the U.S. Market, for many years depressed by surplus production and a regular supplier to the world market.     Mexican supplies, which have sometimes swelled LME stocks, have been normal but are finding ready buyers, traders said.     On the demand side, winter battery manufacture has held up quite well and some U.S. Buying of lead sheet has been reported in the U.K. Soviet lead buying, notably absent in Europe in the first two months of the year, was resumed when a large buying order was filled by merchants in March.     Merchant demand has fuelled the rise in LME lead prices this week and has seen cash metal move above 320 stg and establish a premium of around 10 stg over three months delivery. Specific demand has been directed towards metal in Gothenburg and Trieste warehouses. Gothenburg material is often a target for merchants shipping to the USSR, traders said.     On stocks, the popular LME Continental warehouses, Antwerp and Rotterdam, have little more than 3,000 tonnes of lead each, and this is believed to be in strong hands.     Out of a total 22,125 tonnes in LME stocks, the lowest level since June 1980, just over half is in U.K. Warehouses which are not popular with merchants putting together shipments.     But even U.K. Stocks have dropped around 6,000 tonnes since the start of the year. Traders said this is partly due to secondary smelters buying ingots to supplement feed supplies affected by environmental controls, which put restrictions on the transport of used batteries.     Labour negotiations in North America will play an important part in determining the direction of prices, with contracts expiring end-April at Cominco's Trail and Kimberley, B.C., Mine/smelter and at Doe Run's Herculaneum, Mo, smelter.     Noranda's New Brunswick mine/smelter also has a contract expiry in July which may cause some nervousness in view of strikes by its zinc and copper workers over recent months.     Traders said LME three months delivery, already attracting speculative buying, could rise to 320/330 stg on current firmness, while nearby tightness could widen the cash premium to 20 from four. Three months was quoted at 313 stg at midsession.  Reuter &#3;

Purolator had entered into a definitive agreement with PC Acquisition, part-owned by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc, a unit of E.F.

grain,rice,wheat,sorghum	INDIA FOODGRAIN TARGET 160 MLN TONNES IN 1987/88 .  India's national foodgrain target has been fixed at 160 mln tonnes in 1987/88 (Apr-Mar), unchanged from the 1986/87 target, the Agriculture Ministry said in its annual report for 1986/87.     Actual output was estimated at 151 mln tonnes in 1986/87 due to failure of monsoon rains in 15 out of 35 meterological sub-divisions of the country.     The report gave the targets for various crops with estimated harvested crops in 1986/87 in brackets as following, in mln tonnes - rice 65 (60), wheat 49 (49), coarse grains including sorghum and millets 32 (29) and pulses 14 (13).     Despite failure of monsoon rains in recent years, it was possible to maintain higher foodgrain production, signifying growing resilience in agricultural sector, the report said.     The strategy for increasing irrigation potential along with greater use of high yielding seed varieites and improvement in fertiliser efficiency is yielding results, it said, adding total foodgrain output in 1985/86, 1984/85 and 1983/84 respectively was 150.5 mln tonnes, 145.5 mln and a record 152.4 mln.    India has targeted to produce between 178 and 183 mln tonnes of foodgrains by the last year of the seventh five-year development plan ending March 31, 1990.     Taking the midpoint of 180 mln tonnes as the target and the 1986/87 estimated production of around 151 mln tonnes, the gap of 29 mln tonnes has to be made up during the remaining three years of the plan by increasing grain output annually by more than nine mln tonnes. But the target can be achieved only with good weather, the report said.     "The major thrust programme will, therefore, be better water (irrigation) management. Simultaneously, efforts for spread of improved technology including timely use of inputs (farm materials like fertilisers) in adequate quantities have to be vigrously pursued," it said.  Reuter &#3;

Reichhold said the adoption is not a response to any specific takeover attempt.     Reichhold said each right will entitle shareholders to buy one one-hundreth of a share of a newly created series of preferred stock at an initial exercise price of 120 dlrs, with dividend and voting rights approximately equal to those of one share of the company's common stock.     The rights will be exercisable only if, without Reichhold's prior consent, a person or group a acquires 20 pct or more of the voting power or announces a tender offer which would result in 20 pct ownership, the company said.     Reichhold said it is entitled to redeem the rights at five cts apiece before a 20 pct position has been acquired, or before an existing 20 pct shareholder buys an additional two pct or more of the voting power of the company, or in connection with certain transactions afterward.     The tax-free distribution will become effective May 1, 1987, and will expire 10 years later, the company said.     Details of the plan are outlined in a letter to be mailed to stockholders.

Spain had a 35 mln dlr current account surplus in February compared with a 68 mln dlr surplus in January and a 355 mln dlr surplus in February last year, Bank of Spain figures show.     Spain's trade deficit narrowed to 581 mln dlrs compared with 664 mln dlrs in January but the large increase in non-oil imports contributed to the substantial increase over the 159 mln dlr deficit registered in February 1986.

Non-oil imports totalled 2.79 billion dlrs compared with 1.91 billion in February last year, reflecting the large ammount of investment goods entering the country with the recovery of the Spanish economy, the Bank of Spain said.

earn	VW SAYS 480 MLN MARKS MAXIMUM FOR CURRENCY LOSSES .  Losses for Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F>, VW, linked to an alleged foreign currency fraud will not exceed the 480 mln marks provision already made, a VW spokesman said.     The spokesman was commenting after VW had confirmed it would pay an unchanged 10 mark dividend for ordinary shares on 1986 business, despite the provision.     One West German newspaper today quoted foreign currency dealers in Frankfurt as speculating that the total losses from the currency affair could be as high as 1.5 billion marks, but the VW spokesman described 480 mln marks as an "upper limit."     VW said in a statement following today's supervisory board meeting that it had discussed the foreign currency scandal in detail, and was setting up a new probe into its foreign currency activities to be carried out by an unnamed auditing company.     VW has said computer programs were erased and documents were faked in the alleged fraud in which it believes transactions intended to protect it against possible foreign currency losses were not completed.     VW's former foreign currency chief Burkhard Junger was arrested on Monday on suspicion of embezzlement and of having evaded justice.     Earlier VW had said that its 1986 results would match 1985 profits. VW's group net profit in 1985 was 596 mln marks and parent company net was 477 mln marks. It also said it recommend an unchanged dividend to the supervisory board. The company has also set a dividend of 11 marks for new preference shares, which were issued last year. Analysts have described the held dividend as a move to reassure worried shareholders.     VW increased nominal capital by 300 marks last year to 1.5 billion marks, with the result that its total dividend payment on 1986 will be 306 mln marks compared with 240 mln on 1985, since the new capital was in preference shares.     The share analysts say VW will have to dig into reserves in order to maintain the disclosed 1986 profit at 1985 levels. At the end of 1985, VW had parent company reserves of slightly less than three billion marks.  REUTER &#3;

National Computer Systems Inc expects fiscal year earnings to improve by about 20 pct, the company told analysts, although it said the April 30 first quarter should show "down earnings and virtually flat revenues."     Chairman Charles Oswald said National Computer has taken steps to improve margins. He said revenues are expected to increase modestly because of the company's decision to downsize its leasing business, nonrecurring revenueslast year from a one-time Texas teacher assessment project and the impact of the discontinuance of products last year.     Oswald said National Computer's first quarter results will be down as a result of a major financial systems sales last year, a higher effective tax rate and the increased number of shares outstanding.     The company said the next three consecutive quarters should demonstrate "excellent earnings growth."  Reuter &#3;

The Federal Reserve may intervene in the government securities market to supply temporary reserves indirectly via customer repurchase agreements, economists said.     They said that while the Fed faces no great urgency to add reserves at the start of the two-week maintenance period today it would probably do so in order to offset a relatively high federal funds rate.     Fed funds opened at 6-3/16 pct and remained there in early trading. Yesterday, they averaged 6.45 pct, after rising as high as seven pct at the close.  Reuter &#3;

interest	LAWSON SAYS SOME COUNTRIES COULD CUT RATES .  Nigel Lawson, Britain's Chancellor of the Exchequer, said some countries may need to cut interest rates with the aim of maintaining exchange rate stability.     Speaking to journalists one day after the Group of Seven countries reaffirmed goals set in Paris six weeks ago, he said central banks would continue to intervene "as and when necessary."     He said the G-7 countries were concerned that Japan do more to stimulate domestic demand and welcomed measures outlined by Japanese Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa yesterday.     Lawson said he was still worried about  the risk of a simultaneous recession in the United States, Japan and West Germany, though less so than when he gave his March 17 budget speech to the British Parliament.     "If anything I'm a little bit less concerned, but there is still a risk," he said.     Asked if the United States should consider increasing interest rates to support the dollar, he said, "If there is a need for changes in relative interest rates, it doesn't need to be a rise in interest rates in the United States."     Lawson said there was some concern expressed in yesterday's meetings at the slow progress the United States had made in reducing its budget deficit.     "We believe there will be some worthwhile progress in reducing the deficit this year. The important thing is that it continue year after year," Lawson said.     The February 22 Louvre accord called for efforts to stabilize currencies at then-current exchange rates. In the six weeks that followed the Japanese yen continued to rise against the dollar despite massive central bank intervention.     Asked whether this intervention was a sign of weakness in the Louvre accord, he said, "I don't think so. If there had been no intervention you would have called that a sign of weakness."     Although intervention could be a cause of inflation, Lawson said, "the world does not appear to be in an inflationary mode ... but one has to be vigilant."     He said yesterday's G-7 statement, which affirmed that "current levels" of exchange rates were appropriate, had been "carefully worded." "We know what we mean, and we all mean the same thing," he said.     Lawson said financial markets seem to believe that Japanese measures outlined in the Louvre accord were the source of weakness for that agreement.     Therefore, the G-7 countries welcomed Miyazawa's presentation of plans for a supplemental budget to stimulate domestic demand.     They particularly welcomed the goal of an immediate increase in public works spending, but Lawson said the package also involved a second stage to increase expenditures during the second half of this year.

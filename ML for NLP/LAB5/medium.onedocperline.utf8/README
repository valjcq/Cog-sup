Extract of the "Reuters 21578" dataset, in "one document per line" format.

- medium :
  -- train : 2000 first SGM reuters train documents
  test and dev are taken from the original test set:
  -- test : first 200 SGM reuters test documents
  -- dev : next 200 SGM reuters test documents

NB: in this format, the multilabel cases have been kept
(gold classes are comma-separated)

NB: the *.examples format has been artificially turned into a single-label dataset:
    documents having more than one gold class have been duplicated in the .examples

    For this reason the .dev.examples and the .dev.onedocperline do not contain exactly the same documents

trade	ASIAN EXPORTERS FEAR DAMAGE FROM U.S.-JAPAN RIFT .  Mounting trade friction between the U.S. And Japan has raised fears among many of Asia's exporting nations that the row could inflict far-reaching economic damage, businessmen and officials said.     They told Reuter correspondents in Asian capitals a U.S. Move against Japan might boost protectionist sentiment in the U.S. And lead to curbs on American imports of their products.     But some exporters said that while the conflict would hurt them in the long-run, in the short-term Tokyo's loss might be their gain.     The U.S. Has said it will impose 300 mln dlrs of tariffs on imports of Japanese electronics goods on April 17, in retaliation for Japan's alleged failure to stick to a pact not to sell semiconductors on world markets at below cost.     Unofficial Japanese estimates put the impact of the tariffs at 10 billion dlrs and spokesmen for major electronics firms said they would virtually halt exports of products hit by the new taxes.     "We wouldn't be able to do business," said a spokesman for leading Japanese electronics firm Matsushita Electric Industrial Co Ltd &lt;MC.T>.     "If the tariffs remain in place for any length of time beyond a few months it will mean the complete erosion of exports (of goods subject to tariffs) to the U.S.," said Tom Murtha, a stock analyst at the Tokyo office of broker &lt;James Capel and Co>.     In Taiwan, businessmen and officials are also worried.     "We are aware of the seriousness of the U.S. Threat against Japan because it serves as a warning to us," said a senior Taiwanese trade official who asked not to be named.     Taiwan had a trade trade surplus of 15.6 billion dlrs last year, 95 pct of it with the U.S.     The surplus helped swell Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves to 53 billion dlrs, among the world's largest.     "We must quickly open our markets, remove trade barriers and cut import tariffs to allow imports of U.S. Products, if we want to defuse problems from possible U.S. Retaliation," said Paul Sheen, chairman of textile exporters &lt;Taiwan Safe Group>.     A senior official of South Korea's trade promotion association said the trade dispute between the U.S. And Japan might also lead to pressure on South Korea, whose chief exports are similar to those of Japan.     Last year South Korea had a trade surplus of 7.1 billion dlrs with the U.S., Up from 4.9 billion dlrs in 1985.     In Malaysia, trade officers and businessmen said tough curbs against Japan might allow hard-hit producers of semiconductors in third countries to expand their sales to the U.S.     In Hong Kong, where newspapers have alleged Japan has been selling below-cost semiconductors, some electronics manufacturers share that view. But other businessmen said such a short-term commercial advantage would be outweighed by further U.S. Pressure to block imports.     "That is a very short-term view," said Lawrence Mills, director-general of the Federation of Hong Kong Industry.     "If the whole purpose is to prevent imports, one day it will be extended to other sources. Much more serious for Hong Kong is the disadvantage of action restraining trade," he said.     The U.S. Last year was Hong Kong's biggest export market, accounting for over 30 pct of domestically produced exports.     The Australian government is awaiting the outcome of trade talks between the U.S. And Japan with interest and concern, Industry Minister John Button said in Canberra last Friday.     "This kind of deterioration in trade relations between two countries which are major trading partners of ours is a very serious matter," Button said.     He said Australia's concerns centred on coal and beef, Australia's two largest exports to Japan and also significant U.S. Exports to that country.     Meanwhile U.S.-Japanese diplomatic manoeuvres to solve the trade stand-off continue.     Japan's ruling Liberal Democratic Party yesterday outlined a package of economic measures to boost the Japanese economy.     The measures proposed include a large supplementary budget and record public works spending in the first half of the financial year.     They also call for stepped-up spending as an emergency measure to stimulate the economy despite Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone's avowed fiscal reform program.     Deputy U.S. Trade Representative Michael Smith and Makoto Kuroda, Japan's deputy minister of International Trade and Industry (MITI), are due to meet in Washington this week in an effort to end the dispute.

crude,nat-gas	JAPAN TO REVISE LONG-TERM ENERGY DEMAND DOWNWARDS .  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) will revise its long-term energy supply/demand outlook by August to meet a forecast downtrend in Japanese energy demand, ministry officials said.     MITI is expected to lower the projection for primary energy supplies in the year 2000 to 550 mln kilolitres (kl) from 600 mln, they said.     The decision follows the emergence of structural changes in Japanese industry following the rise in the value of the yen and a decline in domestic electric power demand.     MITI is planning to work out a revised energy supply/demand outlook through deliberations of committee meetings of the Agency of Natural Resources and Energy, the officials said.     They said MITI will also review the breakdown of energy supply sources, including oil, nuclear, coal and natural gas.     Nuclear energy provided the bulk of Japan's electric power in the fiscal year ended March 31, supplying an estimated 27 pct on a kilowatt/hour basis, followed by oil (23 pct) and liquefied natural gas (21 pct), they noted.

Thailand's trade deficit widened to 4.5 billion baht in the first quarter of 1987 from 2.1 billion a year ago, the Business Economics Department said.     It said Janunary/March imports rose to 65.1 billion baht from 58.7 billion. Thailand's improved business climate this year resulted in a 27 pct increase in imports of raw materials and semi-finished products.     The country's oil import bill, however, fell 23 pct in the first quarter due to lower oil prices.     The department said first quarter exports expanded to 60.6 billion baht from 56.6 billion.     Export growth was smaller than expected due to lower earnings from many key commodities including rice whose earnings declined 18 pct, maize 66 pct, sugar 45 pct, tin 26 pct and canned pineapples seven pct.     Products registering high export growth were jewellery up 64 pct, clothing 57 pct and rubber 35 pct.  REUTER &#3;
veg-oil,palm-oil	INDONESIA SEES CPO PRICE RISING SHARPLY .  Indonesia expects crude palm oil (CPO) prices to rise sharply to between 450 and 550 dlrs a tonne FOB sometime this year because of better European demand and a fall in Malaysian output, Hasrul Harahap, junior minister for tree crops, told Indonesian reporters.     Prices of Malaysian and Sumatran CPO are now around 332 dlrs a tonne CIF for delivery in Rotterdam, traders said.     Harahap said Indonesia would maintain its exports, despite making recent palm oil purchases from Malaysia, so that it could possibly increase its international market share.     Indonesia, the world's second largest producer of palm oil after Malaysia, has been forced to import palm oil to ensure supplies during the Moslem fasting month of Ramadan.     Harahap said it was better to import to cover a temporary shortage than to lose export markets.     Indonesian exports of CPO in calendar 1986 were 530,500 tonnes, against 468,500 in 1985, according to central bank figures.  REUTER &#3;
ship	AUSTRALIAN FOREIGN SHIP BAN ENDS BUT NSW PORTS HIT .  Tug crews in New South Wales (NSW), Victoria and Western Australia yesterday lifted their ban on foreign-flag ships carrying containers but NSW ports are still being disrupted by a separate dispute, shipping sources said.     The ban, imposed a week ago over a pay claim, had prevented the movement in or out of port of nearly 20 vessels, they said.     The pay dispute went before a hearing of the Arbitration Commission today.     Meanwhile, disruption began today to cargo handling in the ports of Sydney, Newcastle and Port Kembla, they said.     The industrial action at the NSW ports is part of the week of action called by the NSW Trades and Labour Council to protest changes to the state's workers' compensation laws.     The shipping sources said the various port unions appear to be taking it in turn to work for a short time at the start of each shift and then to walk off.     Cargo handling in the ports has been disrupted, with container movements most affected, but has not stopped altogether, they said.     They said they could not say how long the disruption will go on and what effect it will have on shipping movements.  REUTER &#3;
veg-oil,palm-oil,lumber,coffee,rubber	INDONESIAN COMMODITY EXCHANGE MAY EXPAND .  The Indonesian Commodity Exchange is likely to start trading in at least one new commodity, and possibly two, during calendar 1987, exchange chairman Paian Nainggolan said.     He told Reuters in a telephone interview that trading in palm oil, sawn timber, pepper or tobacco was being considered.     Trading in either crude palm oil (CPO) or refined palm oil may also be introduced. But he said the question was still being considered by Trade Minister Rachmat Saleh and no decision on when to go ahead had been made.     The fledgling exchange currently trades coffee and rubber physicals on an open outcry system four days a week.     "Several factors make us move cautiously," Nainggolan said. "We want to move slowly and safely so that we do not make a mistake and undermine confidence in the exchange."     Physical rubber trading was launched in 1985, with coffee added in January 1986. Rubber contracts are traded FOB, up to five months forward. Robusta coffee grades four and five are traded for prompt delivery and up to five months forward, exchange officials said.     The trade ministry and exchange board are considering the introduction of futures trading later for rubber, but one official said a feasibility study was needed first. No decisions are likely until after Indonesia's elections on April 23, traders said.     Trade Minister Saleh said on Monday that Indonesia, as the world's second largest producer of natural rubber, should expand its rubber marketing effort and he hoped development of the exchange would help this.     Nainggolan said that the exchange was trying to boost overseas interest by building up contacts with end-users.     He said teams had already been to South Korea and Taiwan to encourage direct use of the exchange, while a delegation would also visit Europe, Mexico and some Latin American states to encourage participation.     Officials say the infant exchange has made a good start although trading in coffee has been disappointing.     Transactions in rubber between the start of trading in April 1985 and December 1986 totalled 9,595 tonnes, worth 6.9 mln dlrs FOB, plus 184.3 mln rupiah for rubber delivered locally, the latest exchange report said.      Trading in coffee in calendar 1986 amounted to only 1,905 tonnes in 381 lots, valued at 6.87 billion rupiah.      Total membership of the exchange is now nine brokers and 44 traders.  REUTER &#3;

acq	SUMITOMO BANK AIMS AT QUICK RECOVERY FROM MERGER .  Sumitomo Bank Ltd &lt;SUMI.T> is certain to lose its status as Japan's most profitable bank as a result of its merger with the Heiwa Sogo Bank, financial analysts said.     Osaka-based Sumitomo, with desposits of around 23.9 trillion yen, merged with Heiwa Sogo, a small, struggling bank with an estimated 1.29 billion dlrs in unrecoverable loans, in October.     But despite the link-up, Sumitomo President Koh Komatsu told Reuters he is confident his bank can quickly regain its position.     "We'll be back in position in first place within three years," Komatsu said in an interview.     He said that while the merger will initially reduce Sumitomo's profitability and efficiency, it will vastly expand Sumitomo's branch network in the Tokyo metropolitan area where it has been relatively weak.     But financial analysts are divided on whether and how quickly the gamble will pay off.     Some said Sumitomo may have paid too much for Heiwa Sogo in view of the smaller bank's large debts. Others argue the merger was more cost effective than creating a comparable branch network from scratch.     The analysts agreed the bank was aggressive. It has expanded overseas, entered the lucrative securities business and geared up for domestic competition, but they questioned the wisdom of some of those moves.     "They've made bold moves to put everything in place. Now it's largely out of their hands," said Kleinwort Benson Ltd financial analyst Simon Smithson.     Among Sumitomo's problems are limits placed on its move to enter U.S. Securities business by taking a share in American investment bank Goldman, Sachs and Co.     Sumitomo last August agreed to pay 500 mln dlrs for a 12.5 pct limited partnership in the bank, but for the time being at least, the Federal Reserve Board has forbidden them to exchange personnel, or increase the business they do with each other.     "The tie-up is widely looked on as a lame duck because the Fed was stricter than Sumitomo expected," said one analyst.     But Komatsu said the move will pay off in time.     "U.S. Regulations will change in the near future and if so, we can do various things. We only have to wait two or three years, not until the 21st century," Komatsu said.     Komatsu is also willing to be patient about possible routes into the securities business at home.     Article 65 of the Securities and Exchange Act, Japan's version of the U.S. Glass-Steagall Act, separates commercial from investment banking.     But the walls between the two are crumbling and Komatsu said he hopes further deregulation will create new opportunities.     "We need to find new business chances," Komatsu said. "In some cases these will be securities related, in some cases trust bank related. That's the kind of deregulation we want."     Until such changes occur, Sumitomo will focus on such domestic securities business as profitable government bond dealing and strengthening relations with Meiko Securities Co Ltd, in which it holds a five pct share, Komatsu said.     He said Sumitomo is cautiously optimistic about entering the securities business here through its Swiss universal bank subsidiary, Banca del Gottardo.      The Finance Ministry is expected to grant licences to securities subsidiaries of U.S. Commercial banks soon, following a similar decision for subsidiaries of European universal banks in which the parent holds a less than 50 pct.     But Komatsu is reluctant to push hard for a similar decision on a Gottardo subsidiary.     "We don't want to make waves. We expect this will be allowed in two or three years," he said.     Like other city banks, Sumitomo is also pushing to expand lending to individuals and small and medium businesses to replace disappearing demand from big business, he added.     The analysts said Sumitomo will have to devote a lot of time to digesting its most recent initiatives, including the merger with ailing Heiwa Sogo.     "It's (Sumitomo) been bold in its strategies," said Kleinwort's Smithson.     "After that, it's a question of absorbing and juggling around. It will be the next decade before we see if the strategy is right or wrong."  REUTER &#3;

The Bundesbank accepted bids for 6.1 billion marks at today's tender for a 28-day securities repurchase pact at a fixed rate of 3.80 pct, a central bank spokesman said.     Banks, which bid for a total 12.2 billion marks liquidity, will be credited with the funds allocated today and must buy back securities pledged on May 6.     Some 14.9 billion marks will drain from the market today as an earlier pact expires, so the Bundesbank is effectively withdrawing a net 8.1 billion marks from the market with today's allocation.     A Bundesbank spokesman said in answer to enquiries that the withdrawal of funds did not reflect a tightening of credit policy, but was to be seen in the context of plentiful liquidity in the banking system.     Banks held an average 59.3 billion marks at the Bundesbank over the first six days of the month, well clear of the likely April minimum reserve requirement of 51 billion marks.     The Bundesbank spokesman noted that by bidding only 12.2 billion marks, below the outgoing 14.9 billion, banks themselves had shown they felt they had plenty of liquidity.     Dealers said the Bundesbank is keen to prevent too much liquidity accruing in the market, as that would blunt the effectiveness of the security repurchase agreement, its main open-market instrument for steering market interest rates. Two further pacts are likely this month over the next two weeks.     The Bundesbank is currently steering call money between 3.6 and 3.8 pct, although short-term fluctuations outside that range are possible, dealers said.  REUTER &#3;

Bond Corp Holdings Ltd &lt;BONA.S> and Atlas Consolidated Mining and Development Corp &lt;ATLC.MN> are still holding talks on a bail-out package for the troubled mining firm, an Atlas statement said.     Atlas, the Philippines' biggest copper producer, said it had been hit by depressed world copper prices. It reported a net loss of 976.38 mln pesos in the year ending December 1986, compared with a net loss of 1.53 billion in 1985.     The company said it had been able to cut its losses because its scaled-down copper operations in the central island of Cebu started in the second half of 1986.     Atlas said negotiations were continuing on the acquisition by Bond of the company's existing bank loans and their restructuring into a gold loan.     A memorandum of understanding signed by the two sides in October last year said Bond would acquire Atlas' total loans of 275 mln dlrs, to be repaid by the mining company in gold.     Atlas said the two sides were also discussing equity infusion into Atlas and the creation of a development fund for further exploration and development of the company's gold properties in the central province of Masbate.     Wilson Banks, general manager of &lt;Bond Corp International Ltd> in Hong Kong, told Reuters the Atlas statement on the negotiations was "reasonably accurate."     Banks said Bond Corp was seriously considering several investments in the Philippines but did not give details.     In its statement, Atlas said development of the pre-World War Two underground mines in Masbate had been accelerated and the ore tonnage had increased, extending the operation's life at least until 1993.

trade,rice,livestock,carcass,grain,corn,oilseed,soybean	JAPAN MINISTRY SAYS OPEN FARM TRADE WOULD HIT U.S. .  Japan's Agriculture Ministry, angered by U.S. Demands that Japan open its farm products market, will tell U.S. Officials at talks later this month that liberalisation would harm existing U.S. Farm exports to Japan, a senior ministry official said.     "Imports from the U.S. Would drop due to active sales drives by other suppliers," the official, who declined to be named, said. "Japan is the largest customer for U.S. Farm products and it is not reasonable for the U.S. To demand Japan liberalise its farm import market," he said.     Agriculture Minister Mutsuki Kato has said if the U.S. Insists Japan open its protected rice market it will also open its wheat market, where volume and origin are regulated to protect local farmers.     Australia and Canada could then increase their wheat exports as they are more competitive than the U.S., He said. End-users would also buy other origins, grain traders said.     U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, who is due to visit Japan for talks between April 16-27, has said he will ask Japan to offer a share of its rice market to U.S. Suppliers and remove quotas on U.S. Beef and citrus imports.     Other countries are already cutting into the U.S. Market share here. Australia, the largest beef supplier to Japan, has been trying to boost exports prior to the expiry of a four-year beef accord next March 31.     Imports of U.S. Corn have fallen due to increased sales from China and South America, while Japanese soybean imports from Brazil are expected to rise sharply this year, although the U.S. Will remain the largest supplier.     U.S. Feedgrain sales will also drop if Japan opens up its beef imports, since Japan depends almost entirely on feedgrain imports, mainly from the U.S., Japanese officials said.     An indication of the U.S. Position came last December when Under Secretary of Agriculture Daniel Amstutz said Japan has the potential to provide one of the largest boosts to U.S. Agricultural exports, with the beef market alone representing some one billion dlrs in new business.     The U.S. Has also asked the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade to investigate the legality of Japanese import controls on 12 other farm products, including fruit juices, purees and pulp, tomato juice, ketchup and sauce, peanuts, prepared beef products and miscellaneous beans.     To help calm heated trade relations with the U.S., Japan's top business group Keidanren has urged the government to remove residual import restrictions on agricultural products.     But Agriculture Minister Kato has ruled out any emotional reaction, and the senior ministry official said the farm issue should not become a scapegoat for trade pressure in the industrial sector.     "Japan is the largest buyer of U.S. Farm products, and these issues should not be discussed on the same table," the official said.  REUTER &#3;

South Korea's trade surplus is growing too fast and the government has started taking steps to slow it down, Deputy Prime Minister Kim Mahn-je said.     He told a press conference the government planned to increase investment, speed up the opening of the local market to foreign imports and gradually adjust its currency to hold the surplus "at a proper level."     But he said the government would not allow the won to appreciate too much in a short period of time. South Korea has been under pressure from Washington to revalue the won.     The U.S. Wants South Korea to cut its trade surplus with the U.S., Which rose to 7.4 billion dlrs in 1986 from 4.3 billion dlrs in 1985.     Kim, who is also economic planning minister, said prospects were bright for the South Korean economy, but the government would try to hold the current account surplus to around five billion dlrs a year for the next five years.     "Our government projections of eight pct GNP growth, five billion dlrs of (current account) surplus and 12 pct growth in exports all seemed to be reasonable early this year. But now the surplus is growing faster than we expected," he said.     Trade ministry officials said South Korea's exports rose 35 pct to 9.34 billion dlrs in the first three months of this year, while imports rose only 8.5 pct to 8.2 billion dlrs.     Kim said the swing of South Korea's current account to a surplus of 4.65 billion dlrs in 1986 from an 890 mln dlr deficit in 1985 was very significant. The surplus enabled the country to reduce its foreign debt last year for the first time.     South Korea's foreign debt, which fell to 44.5 billion dlrs in 1986 from 46.8 billion in 1985, is still among the largest in Asia.     "This huge amount of our foreign debt has been one of the major constraints on our development... Last year was a major turning point for the Korean economy," Kim said.     Kim said his government plannned to reduce the ratio of foreign debt to the country's GNP to about 20 pct in 1991, from about 50 pct in 1986.     "The government, however, does not want to accelerate reducing the debt by making an excessive trade surplus," he said.     Kim said a sudden rise in the surplus would cause inflation and lead to trade friction with Seoul's major trading partners, particularly the United States.     "We need a surplus because we have to reduce our debt, but we are taking measures to hold the size of the surplus at a proper level," Kim said.  REUTER &#3;

Finland's national oil company Neste Oy &lt;NEOY.HE> said in a statement it had agreed with Canadian firms to study the feasibility of building a plant in Edmonton, Canada, to produce a replacement for lead in petrol.     The prospective plant would cost an estimated 270 mln Canadian dlrs and would produce methyl tertiary butyl ether (MTBE) from raw materials available locally, it said.     The partners in the study are Neste Oy, Celanese Canada Inc, Hoechst Celanese Corporation and Trade Mountain Pipe Line Company Ltd, of Vancouver, B.C.     The Edmonton site was suitable because of the raw materials availability, the proximity to pipeline transportation and the important capital and operating advantages gained by locating on an existing Celanese Canada site, the statement said.     The partners would look into the feasibility of a plant producing 500,000 tonnes per annum of MTBE, an octane enhancer that can replace tetra ethyl lead.     Most of the MTBE would be targeted for the United States where lead levels in gasoline are being lowered because of health concerns, the statement added.     Canadian lead limits are currently 11 times as high as the U.S. Limit but lead is scheduled for virtual elimination in Canada by 1993, which should create a Canadian demand for MTBE, it said.     Finland's Neste Oy, whose turnover last year was over five billion dlrs, has extensive experience with MTBE. It has a major investment in an MTBE plant in Saudi Arabia.     The Edmonton, Alberta plant would be scheduled to go on stream in late 1989, the statement said.  REUTER &#3;

jobs	GERMAN INDUSTRIAL EMPLOYMENT SEEN STAGNATING .  The number of workers employed in the West German industrial sector stagnated in the last quarter of 1986 as a 50,000 increase in overall employment benefited only the services branch, the DIW economic institute said.     A DIW report added the general downturn in the economy since last Autumn had had a negative effect on the willingness of firms to take on workers. It referred to a marked downturn in the number of workers taken on in the capital goods sector.     New orders for manufacturing industry goods have mostly fallen or stagnated in recent months, but data for February finally showed a reversal of the trend, with a 1.9 pct rise.  REUTER &#3;

Citibank A/S &lt;CCI.N>, the Norwegian subsidiary of the U.S.-based bank, said it made a net loss of just over six mln crowns in 1986 -- although foreign bankers said they expect it to show 1987 profits after two lean years.     Citibank's Oslo treasury head Bjoern Sejerstad told Reuters, Citibank, one of seven foreign bank subsidiaries operating in Norway, lost money because of restructuring for investment banking away from commercial banking and an economic slump in Norway following last year's plunge in oil prices.     Foreign banks have been allowed to operate susbidiaries in Norway since 1985.     Foreign banking analysts in Oslo said access to Norway's second-hand securities and equities markets, to be approved later this spring, and lower primary reserve requirements would make profit this year.     Citibank lost 490,000 crowns in Norway in 1985, but Sejerstad said a profit was likely this year because of planned liberalisation and better economic performance, helped by a steadier oil price of around 18 dlrs a barrel.     Earlier this year, Chase Manhattan Bank's &lt;CMB.N> subsidiary decided to stop foreign exchange trading after heavy losses and focus instead on fee-based merchant banking.  REUTER &#3;

interest,money-fx	ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - AUSTRALIAN MARKETS BOOMING .  Australian markets are booming as foreign fund managers redirect capital away from the United States and other traditional markets, analysts said.     High short-term interest rates, a bullish stock market and an increasingly stable currency reflect a massive inflow of fresh funds in the last two months, largely from Japanese and U.S. Investors, analysts polled by Reuters said.     Fund managers want quality markets to park their cash in and have settled on Australia, Britain and Canada as they diversify from volatile U.S. Dollar instruments, they said.     A one percentage point fall in key 10-year bonds rates in the past month, record share prices and a 10-month high for the currency of 0.71 U.S. Dlrs all illustrated the inflow.     Official figures on the latest inflow of investment capital are not available, but brokers said they received almost daily inquiries from Japan and the United States.     "These people have got trillions of dollars sloshing about and they don't know what to do with it. Some of that is ending up here with the attraction of high interest rates and reasonable currency stability," National Australia Bank Ltd economist Brian Hamley said.     "There is a 'flight to quality'," Hamley said. "Australia may not be in the best (economic) position, but there aren't too many other countries where you'd want to put your money."     The stronger Australian dollar was also attracting investors taking advantage of an appreciating currency against the volatility of the U.S. Unit, analysts said.     "We're looking a more favoured market than perhaps the U.S. Where some people would be concerned about the value of the U.S. Dollar," Lloyds Bank NZA Ltd chief economist Will Buttrose said. "Why not put the money in Australia where entry is cheap and the currency looks stable?"     But turning that capital into more permanent productive investment depends on government economic policy, he said.     "It will only disappear if people lose confidence in the direction in the economy," Buttrose said, adding that offshore investors would carefully watch the government's promised tough economic statement on May 14.     While happy to invest in bonds and other vehicles yielding interest unobtainable elsewhere, fund managers could just as easily reverse the flow -- particularly the Japanese, who were badly hurt in the past by rapid falls in the Australian dollar and hefty jumps in bond rates, analysts said.     "It will remain very edgy money. If something was not to be delivered, if the statement wasn't considered tough enough, one might see a substantial outflow," Buttrose said.     Offshore investors are eager to see Australia take tough economic decisions to curb its 100 billion dlr foreign debt and stubborn current account deficit, analysts said.     "They are giving us the benefit of the doubt and I think they would like to leave the money here," Buttrose said.     Reserve Bank policy has also reflected the increased interest in investment in Australia and the need to shield Japanese investors from rapid currency fluctuations.     Reserve Governor Bob Johnston last week acknowledged an element of targeting the rate against the yen in currency policy when he said authorities could not take their "eyes off the yen" because of the crucial role of Japanese investors.     Analysts said they believed the Reserve Bank had worked successfully in recent months to keep the Australian dollar within the range of 100 to 103 yen.     Apart from its recovery against a weak U.S. Dollar, the Australian dollar has also risen almost three pct on a trade-weighted basis in the last three weeks.     Offshore buying has also played a role in the booming Australian share market. It has followed Wall Street and other markets, but is also setting its own trend in response to the weight of both domestic and offshore funds pouring into equities, particularly in the gold sector.     The key all ordinaries index rose to a record 1,758.3 today, nearly 20 pct above its level at the end of 1986, while the gold index has nearly doubled to a record 3,081.0 in the same period.     The property sector is also sought after, with Japanese companies that have invested heavily in the United States in recent years turning their attention to undervalued real estate, particularly in the tourism field.     Analysts pointed to the recent sale of Sydney's five-star Regent Hotel to Japanese interests for more than 145 mln dlrs as indicative of the type of property being sought.     "They think they find good value real estate here which, with long term and fixed capital investment, is the kind of investment Australia needs," Buttrose added.  REUTER &#3;
gnp,cpi	ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - KUWAITI ECONOMY .  Kuwait's oil-reliant and debt-ridden economy has started to pull out of a nosedive but oil prices will determine the pace of recovery, bankers and economists say.     Crucial will be the ability of the 13-member OPEC to hold oil prices around a new benchmark of 18 dlrs a barrel in the northern hemisphere summer when demand usually slackens.     Bankers estimate the economy, measured in terms of gross domestic product (gdp), shrank 19 pct in real terms last year after contracting 8.1 pct the year before.     This was after taking into account inflation in consumer prices of 1.5 pct in 1985, slowing to 1.0 pct in 1986.     Factors depressing economic activity include the 6-1/2-year-old Iran-Iraq war on Kuwait's doorstep, which threatens the emirate's vital oil export lifeline through the Gulf and has sapped business confidence.     But sentiment received a much-needed boost in September when, after a series of piecemeal steps to combat a debt crisis caused by the 1982 crash of local stock market, a comprehensive new debt settlement program was introduced.     The share crash, result of a speculative spree in forward trading, left 95 billion dlrs of post-dated cheques in default.     The cheques were also used as collateral for consumer spending, thus generating an informal credit system.     Much of the debt has been watered down but big sums are still owed by individuals and companies.     There was some 4.4 billion dinars (about 15.7 billion dlrs) in outstanding bank credit at the end of 1986, of which one-quarter to one-third was estimated by bankers to rank as bad or doubtful debt. But the government has repeatedly said it will not allow any banks to go under.     The new debt settlement scheme entails a rescheduling of problem credit over 10 to 15 years, depending on whether debtors have regular cash flows or not.     Banks' shareholders and depositors will have their rights guaranteed by the government -- an edict of vital significance in a country of only 1.7 mln people where the financial sector is the biggest after oil.     Kuwait is better placed than any other OPEC country to ride out the oil glut, bankers and economists say.     Kuwait has an OPEC quota of 948,000 barrels per day (bpd) compared with production capacity of 4.0 mln bpd mentioned last year by Oil Minister Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah.     But strategic diversification into downstream operations in Europe several years ago and a hefty refining investment at home gives it guaranteed markets abroad and enables it to sell over one-half of its output as high-grade refined oil products.     Oil industry sources say Kuwait is able to get an average 2.00 dlrs a barrel more by selling oil in the form of processed product such as gas oil, kerosene and naphtha, rather than as crude.     Bankers say the rebound in oil prices is the major reason for cautious optimism. Other reasons are low domestic inflation, a bottoming out of the fall in imports in recent years and signs government spending on productive sectors will remain steady.     External accounts are in good shape, with an estimated 1.8 billion dinar current account surplus in 1986, 16 pct below that for 1985, but still an achievement in the recession-hit Gulf.     Kuwait's petrodollar reserves in mid-1986 were put officially at over 80 billion dlrs, earning investment income of the equivalent of about 3.65 billion dlrs a year.     But for the first time since the end of the oil boom, these reserves may not be enough to prevent a "real" budget deficit for the 1986/87 fiscal year ending June 30, bankers say.     In a budget portrayed by bankers as mildly contractionary, revenues for 1986/87 were cut 38.6 pct and spending 11 pct, doubling the nominal deficit to 1.33 billion dinars.     This left out income from state reserves, usually excluded in official budget accounting, which are forecast by bankers at up to 1.0 billion dinars in 1986/87, resulting in some shortfall.     Bankers say it is too early to venture a forecast for economic growth this year or next.     "It depends on oil prices," one said. "This summer is important."     Cabinet Affairs Minister Rashid al-Rashid said last Sunday the cabinet has ratified recommendations to rationalise state spending in favour of productive sectors and reactivate the economy.     He gave no details but bankers say these are expected to be spelled out in the 1987/88 budget, possibly in June.  REUTER &#3;
veg-oil,palm-oil,soy-oil,oilseed,soybean	MALAYSIA MAY NOT MEET 1987 OIL PALM TARGET .  Malaysia is unlikely to meet its targeted output of five mln tonnes of oil palm in calendar 1987, oil palm growers told Reuters.     Output in 1987 is expected to reach around 4.5 mln tonnes, unchanged from 1986, because of drought, low use of fertiliser and overstressed palms, they said.     The growers were asked for their reaction to an Oil World newsletter report that Malaysia's oil palm output is likely to drop sharply this year.     Palm oil now sells at around 700 ringgit a tonne, or about 115 ringgit less than soybean oil, but Malaysia must sell more palm oil to prevent a stock buildup that could damage the industry, a leading grower told Reuters.     The country's palm oil stocks now total some 500,000 tonnes against about 800,000 last March, the growers said.     The growers expect palm oil prices to ease later this year due to pressure from South American and U.S. Soybean output.     The current South American oilseed harvest, mainly soybean, is likely to be around 25.7 mln tonnes against the previous 21.7 mln tonne crop, they said.     In addition, new U.S. Soybean plantings are also expected to enter the market around November when Malaysian palm oil output peaks.     They said new planting of palms is also likely to slow, with some 50,000 hectares expected to be planted with new trees against 100,000 in 1986, although the effects of this reduction will not be felt for about another three years.

A statement said the firm expects to pay total dividends for 1987 of not less than 40 cents a share on the expanded capital.

acq	SAN MIGUEL DEAL HIT BY MORE LAWSUITS .  A bid by San Miguel Corp (SMC) &lt;SANM.MN> to buy back 38.1 mln sequestered shares from United Coconut Planters Bank (UCPB) has been hit by two new lawsuits, sources in the Philippine food and brewery company said.     A Manila court yesterday issued an injunction barring UCPB from selling the shares, which represent 31 pct of SMC's outstanding capital stock of 121 mln shares, until hearings on April 21 on a petition filed by Eduardo Cojuangco, a former chairman of both SMC and UCPB.     Cojuangco said the Coconut Industry Investment Fund (CIIF) and 1.4 mln farmers were the rightful owners of the shares.     Cojuangco said the shares were held in trust by UCPB and represented a blue chip investment. His petition said UCPB's plans to sell the shares to SMC were "a serious breach of fiduciary duties."     The SMC sources said the proposed share sale could also be held up by a second derivative suit filed before the Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) by Eduardo de los Angeles, a government nominee on the company's board.     De los Angeles, who represents SMC's minority stockholders, asked the SEC to block the transaction, approved last week by the company's board.     On April 2 the board sanctioned the repurchase of the sequestered shares for 4.79 billion pesos at 126 pesos per share. De los Angeles told the SEC the company's retained earnings of 1.33 billion pesos would be wiped out by the purchase of the shares and would prevent the declaration of dividends.     De los Angeles said the share purchase would also violate an SMC agreement with its creditors to maintain a 2.2-to-1 debt to equity ratio. He quoted SMC's chief financial director Ramon del Rosario as telling the board that the transaction would boost the ratio to 2.5-to-1.     In petitioning the SEC, de los Angeles amended an earlier suit two weeks ago in which he charged SMC Chairman Andres Soriano III and nine other directors of violating their duties.     De los Angeles' earlier complaint related to SMC assuming last December a 26.5 mln dlr loan contracted by SMC's Hong Kong subsidiary &lt;Neptunia Corp> for a down payment on the shares. The loan assumption was again ratified by last week's board meeting.     An arbitration panel set up by President Corazon Aquino to resolve the ownership issue is expected to submit its report by April 15.     "The amended suit filed by Eduardo de los Angeles is part of a continuing attempt by certain elements, in complete disregard of the facts and with questionable motives, to delay an early disposition of the sequestered shares," San Miguel Corp said in a statement.     "Coming as it does, when San Miguel Corp and UCPB have reached agreement on the price of the shares and the method of payment, this suit is in direct contravention of the government's expressed desire to reach an amicable settlement of the controversy by April 15," the statement added.     A San Miguel spokesman said he had no comment on Cojuangco's court petition, adding: "Any statement coming from us might be interpreted as adversarial."     Meanwhile, Ramon Diaz, the head of a government panel which sequestered the shares last year, said Soriano was not eligible to buy the major portion of the shares because he was a United States citizen.     The sequestered shares are split into 24 mln "A" shares, which can only be owned by Filipinos, and 14 mln "B" shares which are available to foreign buyers.     SMC sources said Soriano personally was not among prospective buyers. They said the shares would be purchased by the &lt;A.Soriano> group of companies, SMC, Neptunia and unnamed institutional investors. Soriano was named as one of the buyers in a bid in March 1986 for 33 mln shares controlled by UCPB.     The sale was aborted when Diaz's Presidential Commission on Good Government sequestered the shares on suspicion they were owned by Cojuangco, a close associate of former President Ferdinand Marcos. Cojuangco lives in self-imposed exile in the U.S.. The shares grew to 38.1 mln after a 15 pct stock dividend announced last June.     "We have no objection to Soriano buying the "B" shares," Diaz told Reuters. "But everything is on hold now."     The SMC spokesman said he did not know if the controversy would be resolved before the company's annual stockholders' meeting, scheduled for May 14.     San Miguel Corp reported sales revenue of 12.2 billion pesos in 1986, 11 pct above its 10.9 billion peso sales in 1985. It said unaudited net profit was in the neighbourhood of 700 mln pesos, an increase of about 50 pct over 1985.  REUTER &#3;
sugar	RAIN BOOSTS CENTRAL QUEENSLAND SUGAR CANE CROP .  Good rains of one to four inches in the past 10 days have boosted moisture-stressed sugar cane crops in the Mackay-Burdekin region of Queensland's central coast, an Australian Sugar Producers' Association spokesman said.     As previously reported, the region has been undergoing a severe dry spell, partly relieved by scattered rainfall, since December, following the virtual failure of the summer wet season.     Mills in the area have been reporting that their crops are beginning to look healthy and greener and are putting on growth since the rains began, the spokesman said from Brisbane.     Although the Mackay-Burdekin crop outlook is much better than it was, there will be some cane losses, the spokesman said. But is too early to say what they will be and more rain is needed to restore sub-soil moisture.     Elsewhere, in far north Queensland, the Bundaberg region and southern Queensland, the cane is in excellent condition and some mills are forecasting record crops, he said.     Initial 1987 crop estimates will probably be compiled towards the end of May, he said.     The cane crush normally runs from June to December.  REUTER &#3;

The European Community (EC) is expected to award export licences at today's weekly tender for above 60,000 and possibly up to 100,000 tonnes of white sugar after last week's award for 102,350 tonnes, traders here said.     They expected a maximum rebate of between 46.40 and 46.50 Ecus per 100 kilos, compared to last week's 46.864.     Earlier, traders in London said the outcome of the tender was very hard to predict after last week's substantial award and the placing of 785,000 tonnes of sugar into intervention.

nickel	NICKEL PRICES UNLIKELY TO RISE MUCH - SHEARSON .  Nickel prices are unlikely to rise significantly from current levels unless further steps are taken to reduce production, Shearson Lehman Brothers said in its quarterly nickel market report.     The market had recovered slightly to around 1.72 dlrs a lb yesterday from its four year low of 1.55 dlrs in early January, due to the absence of Soviet nickel cathode deliveries, but Shearson sees Soviet shipments soon returning to last year's buoyant levels, which should ease current tightness.     Output reductions by producers will take effect later this year but are likely to be offset by increases elsewhere.     Shearson said the nickel market will be virtually in balance during 1987, with total non-Socialist world demand at 556,000 tonnes, compared with an estimated 544,000 tonnes in 1986, production at 505,000 tonnes (504,000) and imports from Socialist countries at 47,000 tonnes (50,000).     It forecast prices will edge higher during the year from a first quarter average of 1.67 dlrs a lb up to 1.77 dlrs in the last quarter. The year's average will be around 1.72 dlrs a lb compared with 1.76 dlrs in 1986, using London Metal Exchange cash metal prices in dollar terms and assuming an average 1987 sterling exchange rate of 1.55 dlrs.

In an initial comment on its 1986 results, DSM said the drop in 1986 turnover had been caused mainly by losses in the company's fertilizer division.  REUTER &#3;
money-fx,dlr	POEHL WARNS AGAINST FURTHER DOLLAR FALL .  Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said a weaker dollar would be risky and a further appreciation of the mark would damage prospects for sustained West German economic growth.     In a speech to the Institute of Contempory German Affairs here, Poehl said "It would be an extremely risky policy to aim for a further substantial decline in the value of the dollar to correct the trade deficit."     He said the United States could face a vicious circle of depreciation, inflation and more depreciation if it took that route.     Poehl noted West Germany had already taken steps to meet U.S. Demands for greater stimulation of its domestic economy, accelerating tax cuts, cutting interest rates and tolerating above-target money supply growth.     He said he would have been happy to have brought forward five billion marks of tax cuts now planned for January 1988 to the beginning of this year, but he said the government faced political constraints getting such measures through the upper house of the West German parliament.     But there were also limits to the impact West Germany could accept on exports from a rising mark, he said.     Poehl said West Germany relied on exports for about one-third of its gross national product, so a substantial erosion of export markets could not be offset by increasing demand at home.     "A further appreciation of the mark could even be an obstacle to further growth," he said.     Poehl said the Bundesbank had tolerated rapid money supply growth last year because the country enjoyed low inflation and because external factors, including low oil prices and favourable terms of trade, had given some extra leeway.     But Poehl said West Germany now faced a difficult dilemma over monetary policy.     The underlying rate of inflation was now two pct, not the reported negative inflation rates last year, and West Germany was affected more than before by exchange rate developments.     "For the time being, we will have to focus our policy more on the external side, and we can live with a more expansionary money supply. But we must be very careful," he said.     He said he shared some of the U.S. Concern about Japan's trade surpluses, which affected European countries as well as the United States.     Poehl welcomed the so-called Louvre accord of monetary officials of major industrialized countries, saying the importance of the February 22 agreement to stabilize exchange rates had been underestimated.     All partners had agreed that the dollar was at about the right level, and that further changes would damage growth, he said.     "This was a remarkable change in attitude, especially on the part of our American colleagues," he said.     But he said there was still a danger that the correction of the dollar's value could overshoot.  REUTER &#3;

The two sides in the Rotterdam port general cargo dispute have agreed to appoint an independent chairman, Han Lammers, to preside over future meetings, employers' spokesman Gerard Zeebregts said.     Lammers, Queen's Commissioner for the province of Flevoland, will not act as a mediator but will draw up an agenda and procedures for meetings between the employers and unions on a work-practice agreement and proposed redundancies.     Two months of strikes in the sector began on January 19 in protest at employers' proposals for 350 redundancies from the 4,000-strong workforce this year.     The strikes were called off by the main port union FNV on March 13 following an Amsterdam court's interim injunction against the redundancies on procedural grounds.     The court is due to make a final ruling on May 7 but Zeebregts said he expected the judgment to go against the employers and they were therefore very likely to restart the complicated legal redundancy procedures in the near future.     Meanwhile, the dispute over a new work-practice agreement in the port's grain sector continued, with 30 maintenance workers on strike, although loading was not affected, a spokesman for Graan Elevator Mij, the largest employer in the sector, said.     The employers have written to the union asking it to reconsider its position and a meeting of union members has been called for tomorrow.  Reuter &#3;

Senate Banking Committee Chairman William Proxmire (D-Wis) said he planned to introduce legislation shortly to require greater public disclosure of corporate takeovers and fairer treatment for all shareholders.     Speaking to the National Association of Manufacturers, Proxmire said recent insider trading stock scandals increased the chance that Congress will act to curb abuses.     "We are proposing legislation that would provide for more disclosure, would be fairer to all shareholders, and would insure that takeovers are properly financed," he said.     Among the provisions, the bill would reduce the threshold for notifying the Securities and Exchange Commission that a investor or group has acquired a percentage of stock in a company to three pct from the current five pct threshold within 10 days, Proxmire said.     In addition, there would be a pre-notificaton requirement that an investor intended to aquire three pct that would have to filed with the SEC.     Proxmire said the pre-notification requirement was meant to prevent arbitragers from having a jump on the general public in knowing about coming takeover attempts.     Proxmire said he would call for extending the period that a tender offer must be kept open under the Williams Act to 60 business days from the current 20 business days.     His bill would provide for private suits if the acquiring company violated the time period on the tender offer.     To correct abuses in the financing of takeovers, Proxmire said the legislation would aim at insuring current margin requirments are properly enforced.     The Federal Reserve Board has a 50 pct margin requirement for purchasing stock, but Proxmire said it is not generally enforced in hostile takeovers.     Rather, the groups or individuals leading a takeover declare that they can raise the capital for a takeover without actually putting any of their own money, Proxmire said.     He said his bill would allow private suits for damages for failure to meet the Federal Reserve's 50 pct margin requirements.     The bill also would require more disclose when several investors form an alliance in a hostile takeover.     "When Pickens and Icahn get together we want people to know about it," Proxmire said.     Proxmire said he favored the approach used in Britain towards two-tiered tender offers that insures that all shareholders recieve equal treatment.     He said he expected amendments to the bill also would cover defensive mechanisms such as green mail and poison pills.     Proxmire said he intended to introduce his bill later this month and predicted the Senate committee would act this spring.     He said he was hopeful Congress could pass a bill this year.

Bankers Trust New York Corp said it has placed its approximately 540 mln dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil on non-accrual status and that first-quarter net income will be reduced by about seven mln dlrs as a result.     Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term debt on February 22.     U.S. banking regulations do not require banks to stop accruing interest on loans until payments are 90 days overdue, but Bankers Trust said it acted now because of "the high potential of a continued suspension that would result in reaching the 90-day limit in the second quarter of 1987."     Assuming no cash payments at current interest rates are received for the rest of 1987, Bankers Trust estimated that full-year net income would be reduced by about 30 mln dlrs.     Bankers Trust said it assumes that debt negotiations between Brazil and its commercial bank lenders will lead to the resumption of interest payments.     The negotiations resume in New York on Friday when central bank governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask banks for a 90-day rollover of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term debt that matures on April 15.

money-fx	STOLTENBERG SEES MOVES TO STRENGTHEN PARIS ACCORD .  West German Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg said today's meetings of major industrial countries would look at ways of strengthening the Paris accord on stabilizing foreign exchange rates.     Stoltenberg told journalists he saw no fundamental weakness of the February 22 agreement of the Group of Five countries and Canada to keep exchange rates near the then-current levels.     But he declined to say what measures would be discussed ahead of a communique of the Group of Seven ministers later today.     Stoltenberg and Bundesbank President Karl Otto Poehl said the importance of the Paris agreement, also known as the Louvre accord, had been underestimated.     Stoltenberg said there is greater agreement now among major countries than six months ago, at the time of the annual meeting of the International Monetary Fund and World Bank, marked by sharp discord between the United States and its major trading partners.     "There is no fundamental weakness of the Paris accord," he said. "We will be looking at ways of strengthening it, but I do not want to discuss that here.     Stoltenberg said the Louvre agreement was working despite a "slight firming" of the yen against the dollar.     And Poehl noted that the dollar/mark parity was unchanged since February 22 without the Bundesbank having had to sell marks to support the dollar.     "The Louvre agreement has been honored by the market," he said.     Poehl said West Germany had lived up to its side of the bargain in Paris by preparing the way for tax cuts to be accelerated as a way of stimulating growth.     Poehl said, however, that Japan had not yet fulfilled its pledges for economic stimulation.     "And we will have to see if the United States is able to do what they promised in Paris on reducing the budget deficit -- and get it through Congress," he added.     Stoltenberg reiterated West German concern about a further fall in the dollar, noting that the mark was up 85 pct against the dollar and nearly 20 pct on a trade-weighted basis.

A total 118,350 tonnes of current series white sugar received export rebates of a maximum 46.496 European Currency Units (Ecus) per 100 kilos at today's European Community (EC) tender, the U.K. Intervention Board said.     Out of this, traders in the U.K. Received 37,800 tonnes, in France 34,500, in West Germany 20,000, in Belgium 18,500, in Spain 5,800 and in Denmark 1,750 tonnes, it added.     Earlier today, London traders had declined to give a projected view on the level of subsidy although some said total tonnage awards would be around 60,000 tonnes.     Paris traders foresaw between 60,000 and 100,000 tonnes being authorised for export at a 46.40/46.50 Ecu subsidy.     Cumulative sales authorisations for the current season (1986/87) now stand at 2,194,970 tonnes (43 weeks).     Last week saw 102,350 tonnes whites authorised for export under licences to end-Sep at the higest ever rebate of 46.864 European Currency Units (Ecus) per 100 kilos.  REUTER &#3;
earn	MEAD &lt;MEA> EXPECTS IMPROVED EARNINGS THIS YEAR .  Mead Corp said the outlook for its major paper markets looks strong for the second quarter and augurs well for its earnings in 1987.     "The generally strong outlook bodes well for significantly improved earnings this year," Burnell Roberts, chairman and chief executive officer said.     Earlier, the company reported first quarter earnings of 34.2 mln dlrs, or 1.09 dlrs a share, versus 20.3 mln dlrs, or 65 cts a share, in last year's first quarter.     In 1986 the company reported earnings from continuing operations of 109.3 mln dlrs, or 3.50 dlrs a share.     Mead said its first quarter benefitted from stronger market conditions and improved operations.     "The combination of capital improvement programs and more employee involvement has been paying off throughout our paper operations," Roberts said.     He added that Mead's pulp and paperboard businesses are operating well as prices have improved and strong demand has placed most products in a sold-out position through the middle of the year.     Mead said sales of its unbleached coated paperboard was particularly strong, up 13 pct versus the first quarter 1986.  Reuter &#3;

sugar	DUTCH SUGAR BEET PLANTING HALF FINISHED .  Roughly half of this year's expected 130,000 hectare Dutch sugar beet crop is already in the ground, a spokesman for Suiker Unie, the largest sugar processor in the Netherlands, told Reuters.     Conditions are generally good and the average sowing date for the crop is expected to be around April 11, against April 23 last year, and a 10-year average of April 14, the spokesman added.     "It is far too early yet to say what kind of output we can expect when it comes to harvest in September, but at least the crop is off to a very good start," he said.     Last year, the Netherlands planted a record 137,600 hectares of sugar beet and produced a record 1.2 mln tonnes of white sugar, substantially more than the country's combined "A" and "B" quota of 872,000 tonnes.     This year, however, a self-imposed quota system has been introduced with the aim of cutting plantings to 130,000 hectares and reducing white sugar output to around 915,000 tonnes to minimise the amount of non-quota "C" sugar produced.     Only farmers with a record of growing suger beet have been allotted quotas. This is expected to prevent the area being boosted by dairy or cereal farmers moving into sugar.  Reuter &#3;

Volkswagen AG &lt;VOWG.F>, VW, is due to make a formal announcement about its 1986 dividend tomorrow after saying the 1985 level of 10 marks per ordinary share would be held, despite massive losses because of a suspected foreign currency fraud.     A spokesman said VW's supervisory board will meet tomorrow to discuss the payout.  A statement will be made afterwards.     VW has also said disclosed profits for 1986 will reach their 1985 level, despite provisions of a possible 480 mln marks linked to the currency affair. The figure is virtually the same as the 477 mln mark 1985 parent company net profit.     When VW first confirmed the currency scandal on March 10 it said the management board would propose an unchanged 10-mark dividend to the supervisory board. A dividend of 11 marks would be proposed for the company's new preference shares.     Share analysts said they saw supervisory board approval of the management board proposal as virtually a formality. "Anything else would be more than a surprise," one said.

grain,corn	ZAMBIA DOES NOT PLAN RETAIL MAIZE PRICE HIKE .  The Zambian government has no immediate plans to follow last week's increase in the producer price of maize with a hike in the retail price of maize meal, an official of the ruling party said.     Last December, a 120 pct increase in the consumer price for refined maize meal, a Zambian staple, led to food riots in which at least 15 people died.     That price increase, which President Kenneth Kaunda later revoked, followed pressure by the International Monetary Fund (IMF) to reduce the government's subsidy bill.     However, if the producer price rise, from 6.10 dlrs to 8.67 dlrs per 90-kg bag, is not accompanied by a retail price increase, the government will have to spend more on subsidies, a practice discouraged by the IMF.     "There is no way out but to raise the subsidy levels of meal. It (the government) would have to choose between the demands of the IMF and those of the people," a Ministry of Agriculture economist said.  Reuter &#3;

grain,corn,sorghum,sunseed,wheat,oilseed,soybean	FURTHER ARGENTINE COARSE GRAIN LOSSES FEARED .  Argentine grain producers adjusted their yield estimates for the 1986/87 coarse grain crop downward in the week to yesterday after the heavy rains at the end of March and beginning of April, trade sources said.     They said sunflower, maize and sorghum production estimates had been reduced despite some later warm, dry weather, which has allowed a return to harvesting in some areas.     However, as showers fell intermittently after last weekend, producers feared another spell of prolonged and intense rain could cause more damage to crops already badly hit this season.     Rains in the middle of last week reached an average of 27 millimetres in parts of Buenos Aires province, 83 mm in Cordoba, 41 in Santa Fe, 50 in Entre Rios and Misiones, 95 in Corrientes, eight in Chaco and 35 in Formosa.     There was no rainfall in the same period in La Pampa.     Producers feared continued damp conditions could produce rotting and lead to still lower yield estimates for all the crops, including soybean.     However, as the lands began drying later in the week harvesting advanced considerably, reaching between 36 and 40 pct of the area sown in the case of sunflower.     Deterioration of the sunflower crop evident in harvested material in Cordoba, La Pampa and Buenos Aires forced yield estimates per hectare to be adjusted down again.     The season's sunflowerseed production is now forecast at 2.1 mln to 2.3 mln tonnes, against 2.2 mln to 2.4 mln forecast last week and down 43.9 to 48.8 pct on the 1985/86 record of 4.1 mln.     Area sown to sunflowers was two to 2.2 mln hectares, 29.9 to 36.3 pct below the record 3.14 mln hectares last season.     Maize harvesting has also reached 36 to 40 pct of the area sown. It is near completion in Cordoba and Santa Fe and will begin in La Pampa and southern Buenos Aires later in April.     Production estimates for maize were down from last week at 9.5 mln to 9.8 mln tonnes, against 9.6 mln to 9.9 mln estimated previously.     This is 22.2 to 23.4 pct below the 12.4 mln to 12.6 mln tonnes estimated by private sources for the 1985/86 crop and 21.9 to 25.8 pct down on the official figure of 12.8 mln tonnes.     Maize was sown on 3.58 mln to 3.78 mln hectares, two to seven pct down on last season's 3.85 mln.     Sorghum was harvested on 23 to 25 pct of the area sown in Cordoba, Santa Fe and Chaco. Harvest will start in La Pampa and Buenos Aires in mid-April.     The total area sown was 1.23 mln to 1.30 mln hectares, 10.3 to 15.2 pct down on the 1.45 mln sown last season.     The new forecast for the sorghum crop is 2.9 mln to 3.2 mln tonnes compared with three mln to 3.3 mln forecast last week, and is 23.8 to 29.3 pct down on last season's 4.1 mln to 4.2 mln tonne crop.     The soybean crop for this season was not adjusted, remaining at a record 7.5 mln to 7.7 mln tonnes, up 4.2 to 5.5 pct on the 7.2 mln to 7.3 mln estimated by private sources for 1985/86 and 5.6 to 8.5 pct higher than the official figure of 7.1 mln.     The area sown to soybeans this season was a record 3.7 mln to 3.8 mln hectares, 10.8 to 13.8 pct up on the record 3.34 mln sown in 1985/86.     The soybean crop is showing excessive moisture in some areas and producers fear they may discover more damage. Some experimental harvesting was carried out in Santa Fe on areas making up only about one pct of the total crop but details on this were not available.     Preparation of the fields for the 1987/88 wheat crop, which will be sown between May and August or September, has so far not been as intense as in previous years.  Reuter &#3;

The figure for male jobless rose by 2,000 in the month to 436,500 compared with 470,700 a year earlier. The figure for women was 256,500 at end-March against 256,100 a month earlier and 259,400 at end-March 1986.

A ministry spokesman said the unadjusted figures showed a smaller than usual seasonal decrease for the time of year, because of particularly cold weather delaying work in the building industry. He said this explained the increase in the adjusted statistics.     Total vacancies available rose by 1,900 to 26,300 at end-March. A year earlier the figure was 28,763.  REUTER &#3;

pet-chem,crude,acq,earn	ENERGY/U.S. PETROCHEMICAL INDUSTRY .  Cheap oil feedstocks, the weakened U.S. dollar and a plant utilization rate approaching 90 pct will propel the streamlined U.S. petrochemical industry to record profits this year, with growth expected through at least 1990, major company executives predicted.     This bullish outlook for chemical manufacturing and an industrywide move to shed unrelated businesses has prompted GAF Corp &lt;GAF>, privately-held Cain Chemical Inc, and other firms to aggressively seek acquisitions of petrochemical plants.     Oil companies such as Ashland Oil Inc &lt;ASH>, the Kentucky-based oil refiner and marketer, are also shopping for money-making petrochemical businesses to buy.     "I see us poised at the threshold of a golden period," said Paul Oreffice, chairman of giant Dow Chemical Co &lt;DOW>, adding, "There's no major plant capacity being added around the world now. The whole game is bringing out new products and improving the old ones."     Analysts say the chemical industry's biggest customers, automobile manufacturers and home builders that use a lot of paints and plastics, are expected to buy quantities this year.     U.S. petrochemical plants are currently operating at about 90 pct capacity, reflecting tighter supply that could hike product prices by 30 to 40 pct this year, said John Dosher, managing director of Pace Consultants Inc of Houston. Demand for some products such as styrene could push profit margins up by as much as 300 pct, he said.     Oreffice, speaking at a meeting of chemical engineers in Houston, said Dow would easily top the 741 mln dlrs it earned last year and predicted it would have the best year in its history.     In 1985, when oil prices were still above 25 dlrs a barrel and chemical exports were adversely affected by the strong U.S. dollar, Dow had profits of 58 mln dlrs. "I believe the entire chemical industry is headed for a record year or close to it," Oreffice said.     GAF chairman Samuel Heyman estimated that the U.S. chemical industry would report a 20 pct gain in profits during 1987. Last year, the domestic industry earned a total of 13 billion dlrs, a 54 pct leap from 1985.     The turn in the fortunes of the once-sickly chemical industry has been brought about by a combination of luck and planning, said Pace's John Dosher.     Dosher said last year's fall in oil prices made feedstocks dramatically cheaper and at the same time the American dollar was weakening against foreign currencies. That helped boost U.S. chemical exports.     Also helping to bring supply and demand into balance has been the gradual market absorption of the extra chemical manufacturing capacity created by Middle Eastern oil producers in the early 1980s.     Finally, virtually all major U.S. chemical manufacturers have embarked on an extensive corporate restructuring program to mothball inefficient plants, trim the payroll and eliminate unrelated businesses. The restructuring touched off a flurry of friendly and hostile takeover attempts.     GAF, which made an unsuccessful attempt in 1985 to acquire Union Carbide Corp &lt;UK>, recently offered three billion dlrs for Borg Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, a Chicago manufacturer of plastics and chemicals. Another industry powerhouse, W.R. Grace &lt;GRA>  has divested its retailing, restaurant and fertilizer businesses to raise cash for chemical acquisitions.     But some experts worry that the chemical industry may be headed for trouble if companies continue turning their back on the manufacturing of staple petrochemical commodities, such as ethylene, in favor of more profitable specialty chemicals that are custom-designed for a small group of buyers.     "Companies like DuPont &lt;DD> and Monsanto Co &lt;MTC> spent the past two or three years trying to get out of the commodity chemical business in reaction to how badly the market had deteriorated," Dosher said. "But I think they will eventually kill the margins on the profitable chemicals in the niche market." Some top chemical executives share the concern.     "The challenge for our industry is to keep from getting carried away and repeating past mistakes," GAF's Heyman cautioned. "The shift from commodity chemicals may be ill-advised. Specialty businesses do not stay special long."     Houston-based Cain Chemical, created this month by the Sterling investment banking group, believes it can generate 700 mln dlrs in annual sales by bucking the industry trend.     Chairman Gordon Cain, who previously led a leveraged buyout of Dupont's Conoco Inc's chemical business, has spent 1.1 billion dlrs since January to buy seven petrochemical plants along the Texas Gulf Coast.     The plants produce only basic commodity petrochemicals that are the building blocks of specialty products.     "This kind of commodity chemical business will never be a glamorous, high-margin business," Cain said, adding that demand is expected to grow by about three pct annually.     Garo Armen, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds, said chemical makers have also benefitted by increasing demand for plastics as prices become more competitive with aluminum, wood and steel products. Armen estimated the upturn in the chemical business could last as long as four or five years, provided the U.S. economy continues its modest rate of growth.  Reuter &#3;

acq	DOMINION CALLS BURLINGTON &lt;BUR> REPORT RUMOR .  &lt;Dominion Textile Inc> considers a published report that it has bought a stake in Burlington Industries Inc and is considering making a joint bid for the company to be a rumor, a company spokesman said.     "As far as I am concerned and the company is concerned, they are rumors and we're not commenting on rumors," spokesman Michel Dufour told Reuters in response to a query.     "All the information that has been given out publicly is that, yes, Dominion Textile is interested in making an acquisition that big...probably based on that people are starting all sorts of rumors," he said.     Dufour said yes when asked whether the report was only a rumor, but said the company was not prepared to comment further. Dominion Textile president and chairman Thomas Bell was out of town and unavailable for comment.     Dominion Textile last year made an unsuccesful 104-mln- U.S.-dlr bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120-mln- U.S.-dlr line of credit to be used for an American acquisition.     Dufour said the company has been negotiating with "many" U.S. textile companies but would not say whether Burlington Industries was one of them.     Burlington's stock rose sharply this morning on the report, which said Dominion Textile had joined with U.S. investor Asher Edelman to buy a stake in the company and to consider making a takeover offer.     Dominion Textile, which reported operating profit of 11.1 mln Canadian dlrs last year on sales of 926.5 mln dlrs, has repeatedly said it will concentrate on expanding into the U.S.     The company has said it plans to diversify into new product and market areas in addition to expanding its textile operations.

cocoa	COCOA EXPORTERS EXPECTED TO LIMIT SALES .  Major cocoa exporters are likely to limit sales in the weeks ahead in an effort to boost world prices, sources close to a meeting of the Cocoa Producers Alliance (CPA) said.     The sources said the depressed world market had been one of the main topics discussed in a closed door meeting of the 11-member CPA which began on Monday.     They said producers agreed that cutting sales would aid the buffer stock manager of a new international cocoa pact in his effort to support prices.     Major cocoa producing and consuming nations agreed operation rules for the buffer stock at a meeting in London last month and the stock manager is expected to enter the market soon.     Prices, under the weight of three successive cocoa surpluses, recently fell to the level at which the manager has to buy cocoa under stock rules.     The buffer stock aims to keep prices within a pre-set range by buying when prices fall and selling when they rise.     "The world's cocoa price at present is just not interesting," commented one delegate representing a major CPA producer.     Another source said that with much of the 1986/87 (October-September) world cocoa crop sold, limiting sales in the near term concerns essentially next year's harvest.     The sources noted, however, that the cocoa industry in Brazil, the world's number two producer, is in private hands. This means limiting sales is more difficult than in major West African producers, where sales are made or authorized by commodity marketing boards.     The CPA includes the world's top three producers, Ivory Coast, Brazil and Ghana, and accounts for 80 pct of all output.     The meeting here is due to end tomorrow evening.  Reuter &#3;

earn	J.P. MORGAN &lt;JPM> NET HURT BY BRAZIL, TRADING .  J.P. Morgan and Co Inc said its first-quarter earnings fell by 3.2 pct, largely reflecting its previously announced decision to place on non-accrual status its 1.3 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term loans to Brazil.     That decision, spurred by Brazil's suspension of interest payments on February 20, reduced the quarter's net income by 20 mln dlrs to 226.4 mln dlrs, compared with 233.9 mln in the first three months of 1986.     Morgan also reported a loss of 1.8 mln dlrs from securities underwriting and trading, in contrast to a gain of 45.4 mln dlrs in the year-earlier period.     In the fourth quarter of 1986, Morgan posted other trading losses of 5.5 mln dlrs because of setbacks in the trading and underwriting of Euromarket securities.     Conditions in some sectors of the Euromarket remained difficult last quarter, with floating rate notes suffering heavy price falls, but a spokeswoman was unable to say whether Morgan's trading losses were restricted to the Euromarket.     On the positive side, Morgan reduced its provision for loan losses to 35 mln dlrs from 70 mln a year earlier. Foreign exchange trading income rose to 82 mln dlrs from 72.6 mln and trust income increased to 95.9 mln dlrs from 75.9 mln.     Morgan said other operating income, mainly fees and commissions, rose to 102.2 mln dlrs from 88.4 mln, but net investment securities gains dropped to 43.1 mln from 58.1 mln.     Net interest earnings were 490.4 mln dlrs in the first quarter, down from 499.4 mln a year earlier, and net yield fell to 2.79 pct from 3.20 pct.     If Brazil had not been placed on non-accrual, which means that interest can be recorded as income only when payments are actually received, net interest earnings would have been 525.9 mln dlrs and net yield 2.99 pct. If Brazil does not resume payments, 1987 net would be cut by 72 mln dlrs, Morgan added.     After the provision for loan losses, Morgan's allowance for credit losses at the end of March totaled 953 mln dlrs compared with 910 mln at end-1986 and 815 mln a year earlier.     It reported net recoveries of six mln dlrs after charge-offs of eight mln, compared with net charge-offs of 49 mln dlrs after recoveries of three mln a year earlier.     Excluding Brazil, non-accruing loans at quarter's end were 583 mln dlrs, down from 633 mln at end-1986 and 684 mln a year earlier. Non-interest expenses rose to 371.1 mln dlrs from 303.5 mln dlrs, with more than half the increase related to personnel costs, Morgan said.  Reuter &#3;

grain,corn,oilseed,soybean	BRAZIL GRAIN HARVEST FACES STORAGE PROBLEMS .  Storage problems with Brazil's record grain crop are likely to result in losses of about five mln tonnes, an Agriculture Ministry spokesman said.     Ministry spokesman Leonardo Brito, speaking from Brasilia, told Reuters he believed that about five mln tonnes of this year's estimated crop of 65 mln tonnes would be lost.     He said part of this would be the normal loss inevitable in harvesting, but that most of it would stem from storage problems.     Brazil has a storage capacity of 66 mln tonnes, theoretically sufficient for the crop.     But Brito said that the storage capacity was badly distributed. The states of Sao Paulo, Parana and Rio Grande do Sul had between them 70 pct of the nation's capacity, but were responsible for only 50 to 60 pct of production.     The biggest problems are concentrated in the Centre-West growing regions, where rising production has outpaced storage capacity.     Brito said the Centre-West, whose crops include soya and maize, had between 30 and 40 pct of the nation's grains production but only 20 pct of its storage space.     In addition to the poor distribution of storage units, there is the problem that too much of the capacity is geared to storing grain in sacks, while not enough is suitable for storing loose grain, Brito said.     Finally, there is a shortage of lorries to transport the crops.     The sheer scale of the task in transporting the record crop has been evident from television reports, which have shown enormous queues of lorries waiting outside granaries.  Reuter &#3;

Exchanges and telecommunications authorities should abolish their restrictions on full and free dissemination of information to the investment and banking communities, Reuters Holdings Plc &lt;RTRS.L> chairman Sir Christopher Hogg said.     In the 1986 annual repoprt, he said lengthy negotiations had brought agreement with the Tokyo and London Stock Exchanges for fuller, but still not complete, access to market data through Reuter services.     "Many other markets maintain restrictions," he added.     Hogg said members of some markets appear to believe that information restrictions protected their interests.     In other cases, exchanges seem to be limiting the distribution of data in order to provide competitive advantage to their own commercial information businesses.     He also noted that despite increasing liberalisation in the telecommunications field, some countries continue to protect their state monopolies at the expense of other economic sectors.     "Reuter dealing services remain excluded from such countries. As a result, banking communities serving entire economies are put at a competitive disadvantage," he added.     Reuters increased its 1986 pre-tax profit by 39 pct from the previous year to 130.1 mln stg on a 43 pct rise in revenues to 620.9 mln stg.     Earnings per ordinary share were up 47 pct to 19.4p.

The Association of White Metals has decided to publish a daily tin price here in French francs per 100 kilos, the French Federation of Non-Ferrous Metals said.     The price, quoted for the first time yesterday, was introduced as the lack of tin quotes was causing problems for some French companies, a spokesman for the non-ferrous metals association said.     Today's price was set at 4,776 francs per 100 kilos and Tuesday's at 4,790.     The International Chamber of Commerce stopped publishing a tin price after the London Metal Exchange (LME) stopped tin trading on October 24, 1985.     The Association has tested the basis it uses to calculate a French franc price over the last few months to ensure it was reliable, the spokesman said.     The French franc price is pre-tax, for specified quality, a minimum 99.9 pct purity, at a French port or border railway station and a minimum delivery of 10 tonnes.

Agrimont, still wholly owned by Montedison, is taking steps to be traded on the Milan exchange, the company said.     The company said that 1986 was characterized by an unstable fertlizer market due to the weak dollar and the decline of international prices for products sold in Europe and the U.S where Agrimont operates through its Conserv division.     In pesticides and in animal health care products Agrimont maintained its previous level of revenues and market share in 1986, Montedison said.

acq	TALKING POINT/BURLINGTON INDUSTRIES &lt;BUR> .  The largest U.S. textile maker focused on its own business as its competitors found merger partners, but now Burlington Industries Inc may have restructured itself into an attractive takeover candidate, analysts said.     The takeover spotlight fell today on Burlington, which rose 4-7/8 to 52-7/8 on speculation that investor Asher Edelman and Dominion Textiles Inc of Canada bought an almost five pct stake.     A published report said Edelman and Dominion jointly acquired a stake in Burlington and were weighing a takeover offer. Edelman would not comment, and a spokesman for Montreal-based Dominion called the report just "rumors."     Burlington said it did not know if the report was true.     Wall Street professionals said they were not convinced of the story or that Edelman and Dominion would be the victors if Burlington actually came into play.     Arbitragers said past comments from Dominion, however, added credence to the speculation. Dominion has said that it was looking for a takeover in the U.S.     Last year, Dominion unsuccessfully bid for Avondale Mills and has maintained a 120 mln dlr line of credit to be used for a U.S. acquisition.     A Dominion spokesman said Canada's largest textile producer has been negotiating with "many" U.S. textile companies, but would not say whether Burlington was among them.     "There have been acquisitions in this area. It's not unusual that someone could be looking at Burlington after the housecleaning they've done," said Eileen Gormley of Thomson McKinnon.     Burlington sold its domestic operations, which made sheets and other linens, to J.P. Stevens and Co Inc for 110 mln dlrs last year. It also has reorganized management, and focused its operations on businesses that would be less affected by foreign competition, Gormley said.     "They've pulled back so as not to be a commodity marketer," said Gormley. She said in moving more heavily into industrial fabrics, Burlington bought C.H. Masland, which supplies carpets and other fabric to the auto industry.     "In the past, they just spent and never realized the return on the outlays they did make," she said.     "You look at their record over the year, and I think they're poised to be more profitable than they had been in the past," Gormley said.      She estimated 1987 earnings of 2.50 dlrs per share, up from 2.01 dlrs per share.     Some analysts today recommended clients not buy Burlington at its current levels.     Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook said he recommends selling. He said he believes the stock is worth only about 50 dlrs on a takeover basis and about 46 dlrs on an earnings basis.     Some arbitragers, however, said takeover values have been placed on the company of 60 to 65 dlrs per share.     "After Asher's (Edelman) recent history, a lot of people don't find him very credible anymore," said one arbitrager.     Another, however, said Edelman succeeds in forcing managements to take steps to enhance shareholder values even if he doesn't win the target company.     Edelman was unsuccessful last year in offers for Lucky Stores Inc and Fruehauf Corp. He did succeed in buying Ponderosa Inc.     The stocks of other textile makers rose along with Burlington.

trade	JAPAN IN LAST-DITCH EFFORT TO AVERT TARIFFS .  Senior Japanese officials tomorrow open talks with American trade negotiators in a last-ditch effort to avert new high U.S. tariffs to be imposed on a wide variety of Japanese electronic exports.     Makoto Kuroda, vice minister of Japan's Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), is to hold two days of meetings with the Deputy U.S. Trade Representative, Michael Smith, and the Under Secretary of Commerce, Bruce Smart.     The new tariffs, to go into effect on April 17, are in retaliation for Japan's failure to adhere to an agreement to end dumping semiconductors in world markets at below cost and to open its home market to U.S. semiconductor shipments.     They are to be imposed on goods which use semiconductors, including television and audio equipment and computers.     Both U.S. and Japanese officials have said there was little likelihood the talks would do anything to avert the 100 pct duties on 300 mln dlrs worth of Japanese shipments.     President Reagan announced the planned tariffs on March 27 after he said that close monitoring of the July 1986 U.S.-Japanese semiconductor pact convinced U.S. officials that Japan was not honoring the agreement.     In making the annoucement, Reagan said "I am committed to the full enforcement of our trade agreements designed to provide American industry with free and fair trade."     Trade analysts said his move was aimed as much at Japan's semiconductor trade practices, which are said to have injured the U.S. semiconductor industry, as Congress, which has complained about presidential timidity on trade issues.     Congressional Democrats have pledged to enact aggressive trade laws to counter what they contend has been Reagan's inaction to redress the growing U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 169.8 billion dlrs.     About one-third of the deficit was with Japan.     Reagan said there were recent signs Japan was beginning to adhere to the pact and that was why he was not terminating it.     Kuroda said on leaving Tokyo today he had no new proposals but did have an explanation of the semiconductor situation.     He told the daily newspaper Ashai Shimbun that Reagan's decision was based on inaccurate data and an exaggerated sense of MITI's power to control Japanese traders.     "The United States has excessive expectations.," he said. To stabilize supply-demand relations which have been disrupted by excess inventories since 1985 will take some time."     He also said that U.S. firms had not been aggressive enough in trying to sell in the Japanese market.  Reuter &#3;

earn	HEINEKEN SEES HIGHER PROFITS, WIDER PENETRATION .  Dutch brewer Heineken NV said it hoped to maintain for a number of years a similar earnings growth to the 7.5 pct increase in net profit achieved in 1986, despite continuing investments in a reorganization program and efforts to extend world penetration.     Heineken last month reported a 1986 net profit of 285 mln guilders, after 265 mln in 1985.     Chairman Freddie Heineken said the company, Europe's leading beer producer with six pct of market share in 1986, said sales increased by 6.3 pct to 42.1 mln hectoliters.     The volume increase was due mainly to a rise in the U.S., Where the brand Amstel Lite saw great demand, and in Europe, where sales accounted for 25.5 pct of the total.     Turnover, despite losses in guilder terms due to weaker foreign currencies, rose by 4.4 pct, to 6.7 billion guilders.     Further consolidation of foreign companies, including the increase of its stake in leading Spanish brewery &lt;El Aguila S.A.> to 51.2 pct, new ventures and modernization, particularly in French and Spanish interests, eroded profit margins. The company still planned to invest 700 mln guilders this year in restructuring and marketing, Heineken said.     Heineken's Spanish activities should start yielding profit next year, Heineken said, adding that its French operations had already turned to profit after vast rationalization last year.     Vice Chairman Gerard van Schaik said the decision by the European Court of Justice in Luxembourg to allow foreign beer into the closed West German market -- Europe's biggest beer market -- offered interesting possibilities for Heineken. "We have the beer, but distribution and sales is the important point," van Schaik said, adding that since the ruling Heineken had been inundated by German traders seeking joint ventures.     "The question is not if we want to penetrate the German market, but how we are to do it," van Schaik said, adding that while the widely traveled Germans seemed to be developing a taste for foreign beer, the internal structure was very regionalized.      Heineken board member Hans Coebergh, responsible for African operations, said he saw Africa as one of the most important beer growth markets in the long term.      He said the company, present in Africa since 1932 and with majority stakes in six breweries and interests in 25, was hampered by the lack of hard currencies there.     Africa, where beer consumption averages only nine liters per head per year and sales are limited by import restrictions and currency risks, nonetheless accounted for 6.5 pct of total 1986 sales.     On-site production is rendered expensive by the high price of imports of essential ingredients. But Heineken scientists have been looking at other possibilities.     To balance the costs of imported malt, Heinken launched on the Nigerian market a new beer made of 50 pct sorghum, which had sold successfully, Coebergh said.     Heineken is urging farmers to grow the traditional raw materials, but Coebergh noted that banana and palm beer were popular in Rwanda . "This is a possibility, but we could not possibly achieve the Heineken flavor," Coebergh said.     Chairman Heineken said the company's seven year efforts to penetrate the Soviet market had finally resulted this week in a contract that relaxed some of the restrictions they faced.     But again, a lack of hard currencies limited Heineken's market potential. Heineken now has seven bars in Moscow that are enjoying good sales, but the bars only accept western money.  Reuter &#3;

"As the issue is basicly political, a solution can only be found by bilateral negotiations," the statement said. Greece has repeatedly said the issue was legal and could be solved at the International Court of Justice.     The two countries approached armed confrontation last month after Greece announced it planned oil exploration work in the Aegean and Turkey said it would also search for oil.     A face-off was averted when Turkey confined its research to territorrial waters. "The latest crises created an historic opportunity to solve the disputes between the two countries," the Foreign Ministry statement said.

Aart de Zeeuw, chairman of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade's negotiating group on agriculture, met this morning with members of the House Agriculture Committee.     Committee sources said De Zeeuw expressed concern over protectionism and high farm price supports. House lawmakers noted that in 1985 the United States took steps to reduce loan rates, committee staff said.     "Members told him (De Zeeuw) that we lowered our (U.S.) loan rates and can't eliminate subsidies unilaterally," one source said.     De Zeeuw was told of the U.S. lawmakers' frustration with Japan's restrictive rice import policy, and members defended the U.S. dairy policy, which aims to cut surplus production by subsidizing producers to trim herds, sources said.     Later today De Zeeuw will meet the Senate Agriculture members and Undersecretary of State Affairs Allen Wallis.     Tomorrow, De Zeeuw is to meet the House Ways and Means Trade Subcommittee and the Senate Finance Committee, before visiting Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng.

The relatively high level of real U.S. interest rates suggests that there is scope for further declines in money market rates, but the Federal Reserve is unlikely to promote such a drop as long as the dollar remains volatile, said J.P. Morgan and Co Inc chairman Lewis Preston.     He said in response to a reporter's question after the bank's annual meeting that money market rates could decline further but, "I don't think the Fed is going to encourage that as long as the exchange markets are as volatile as they are."     On the other hand, he said that, barring a collapse of the dollar, he did not see rates going much higher.     He said that Morgan's recent rise in its prime lending rate was "purely a reflection of an increase in a whole spectrum of rates."     Preston reiterated earlier company forecasts that the U.S. economy should show roughly 2.5 to three pct real growth this year.

In the year ago period, the company earned 53.4 mln dlrs, or 3.65 dlrs a share, on sales of 402.8 mln dlrs.     Winston Wallin, Medtronic chairman, said the company will improve market share in fiscal 1988 in cardiac pacemakers and expand its cardiovascular therapeutic product line.     Wallin cautioned analysts not to quickly change their per share estimates for the company as he said Medtronic will have heavy sales and marketing expenses in fiscal 1988.     He said the company intends to reinvest its earnings in its businesses and not in its dividends. "Shareholders are better off if we grow the business rather than reinvest in dividends or share repurchases," he said.     Wallin said he sees Medtronic's share of the total worldwide pacemaker market increasing to 42 pct in fiscal 1988, from 40 pct in fiscal 1987.     He said the worldwide market for cardiovascualr therapeutic products, which includes pacemakers, valves, catheters and lasers, will be valued at about 2.5 billion dlrs 1990 and will double that by 1995.     Wallin said, "Our objective is to get a hold of new products and start building market share if we have to beg, borrow or steal to get into new markets."     In the past, Medtronic's pacemakers have been plagued with a number of problems leading to product recalls. Regulators also have criticized the industry, citing quality problems and a needless overprescription of pacemakers.     "We have no knowledge of any major problems in our pacemakers or leads," Wallin said. "We intend to re-establish our company as the quality leader in the industry."     Glen Nelson, executive vice president for Medtronics, said the company intends to diversify internally and through acquisitions of companies in areas of Medtronic's expertise, such as drug delivery systems.     Wallin said the 15 pct earnings growth for fiscal 1988 does not include dilutions from acquisitions. "We hope to have some safety provisions so that we won't have any major dilutions from an acquisition."     Wallin also said the company will have virtual exclusivity in rate responsive pacemakers for all of fiscal 1988.     The company markets Activitrax, the first single chamber pacemaker that varies heartrate in response to physical activity.     Siemens AG, a West German company, is also developing a rate responsive pacemaker.      Reuter &#3;

The White House said high U.S. Tariffs on Japanese electronic goods would likely be imposed as scheduled on April 17, despite an all-out effort by Japan to avoid them.     Presidential spokesman Marlin Fitzwater made the remark one day before U.S. And Japanese officials are to meet under the emergency provisions of a July 1986 semiconductor pact to discuss trade and the punitive tariffs.     Fitzwater said: "I would say Japan is applying the full-court press...They certainly are putting both feet forward in terms of explaining their position." But he added that "all indications are they (the tariffs) will take effect."  Reuter &#3;
earn	SHOWBOAT &lt;SBO> TO TAKE CHARGE, SEES 3RD QTR LOSS .  Showboat Inc will take a charge of 19 to 20 mln dlrs pretax against results for the third quarter ended March 31, director and assistant to the president J. Kell Houssels III told Reuters.     He said the charge results from pre-operating expenses of its recently-opened Atlantic City, N.J., Showboat Hotel, Casino and Bowling Center and will cause a loss for the third quarter and probably for all of fiscal 1987 as well.     But Houssels said Showboat's earnings for fiscal 1988 should show a sharp increase from fiscal 1986 levels due to the contribution of the new Atlantic City facility.     Showboat earned 1,753,000 dlrs in last year's third quarter.  For all of fiscal 1986 it earned 5,769,000 dlrs.     Houssels said Showboat since the opening of the Atlantic City hotel/casino, Showboat has had to start charging interest expenses connected with debt it sold to finance the facility directly against income rather than capitalizing the interest as it had been able to do previously.     Showboat opened the hotel during its third quarter and gaming began last Thursday on a regular basis after test gaming was completed earlier in the week.  Reuter &#3;
earn	SECURITY PACIFIC &lt;SPC> LOANS PUT ON NON-ACCRUAL .  Security Pacific Corp said it is placing medium and long-term loans to Brazil and Ecuador on a non-accrual basis as of March 31, a move that will reduce first quarter earnings by 7.2 mln dlrs, or nine cts per share, after taxes.     Despite the anticipated reduction to quarterly earnings, Security Pacific said it still expects to report first quarter earnings higher than the 88 mln dlrs, or 1.11 dlrs per share reported for the first quarter of 1986.     The bank holding company said the action affects 401 mln dlrs of loans to Brazil and 73 mln of loans to Ecuador.     Brazil suspended interest payments on its 68 billion dlrs of medium- and long-term debt on February 20.     Ecuador, which has foreign debt of roughly eight billion dlrs, has not paid any interest to foreign banks since February.     In March Ecuador said it would suspend interest payments for the rest of the year because of an earthquake which halted the export of oil, which accounts for about 75 pct the country's export revenues.     In its announcement, Security Pacific said it will record interest income only as it is received in cash.     The company also said it believes that Brazil will reach an agreement with its banks and that interest payments will resume later in 1987.     The Brazilian negotiations resume on Friday in New York when Central Bank Governor Francisco Gros is expected to ask banks for a 90-day roll-over of some 9.5 billion dlrs of term debt that matures on April 15.

crude	IRAQI TROOPS REPORTED PUSHING BACK IRANIANS .  Iraq said today its troops were pushing Iranian forces out of positions they had initially occupied when they launched a new offensive near the southern port of Basra early yesterday.     A High Command communique said Iraqi troops had won a significant victory and were continuing to advance.     Iraq said it had foiled a three-pronged thrust some 10 km (six miles) from Basra, but admitted the Iranians had occupied ground held by the Mohammed al-Qassem unit, one of three divisions attacked.     The communique said Iranian Revolutionary Guards were under assault from warplanes, helicopter gunships, heavy artillery and tanks.     "Our forces are continuing their advance until they purge the last foothold" occupied by the Iranians, it said.     (Iran said its troops had killed or wounded more than 4,000 Iraqis and were stabilising their new positions.)     The Baghdad communique said Iraqi planes also destroyed oil installations at Iran's southwestern Ahvaz field during a raid today. It denied an Iranian report that an Iraqi jet was shot down.     Iraq also reported a naval battle at the northern tip of the Gulf. Iraqi naval units and forces defending an offshore terminal sank six Iranian out of 28 Iranian boats attempting to attack an offshore terminal, the communique said.      Reuter &#3;

crude,earn	UNION TEXAS OIL RESERVES DROPPED IN 1986 .  Union Texas Petroleum said its worldwide proved reserves fell to 511 mln barrels of oil equivalent at the end of 1986 from 555 mln barrels reported in 1985.     In its newly released annual report, Union Texas said it replaced about 71 pct of its production of 56 mln barrels of oil equivalent last year after taking into account the sale of 27 mln barrels of U.S. reserves.     Union Texas, the nation's largest independent oil and gas producer based on revenues, is a privately-held company owned by Kohlberg Kravis Roberts and Co and Allied-Signal Inc &lt;ALD>.     The Houston-based company said it lost 57.5 mln dlrs on 1.26 billion dlrs in sales last year, compared to profits of 165 mln dlrs on 2.04 billion dlrs in sales in 1985.     Union Texas said it received an average of 13.35 dlrs per barrel for its international oil production and 2.99 dlrs per mcf for its foreign natural gas sales. The majority of the company's total energy production is in the United Kingdom, Indonesia and Pakistan.     In the United States, Union Texas said it completed evaluation work on its oil find in Alaska's Colville Delta area.     "Although significant oil reserves were confirmed, development of this discovery will not be economical without substantially higher prices," the company said.     Union Texas said it planned to spend about 42 mln dlrs over the next two years to develop its Eugene Island Block 371 in the Gulf of Mexico.     In 1987, the company said it budgeted 178 mln dlrs for capital spending, less than half of the amount spent in 1985 and down from 199 mln dlrs budgeted last year. Union Texas also said it would seek acquisitions of oil and gas properties as well as petrochemical-related businesses.  Reuter &#3;
acq	UAL &lt;UAL> MAY RESPOND TO PILOTS TODAY .  UAL Inc may have a response this afternoon to the pilots union proposal to buy its United Airlines unit, a UAL spokesman said.     "Obviously, we have a lot of movement in our stock, and we need to get a clarification out," the spokesman said, adding that there was a "50-50" chance a statement would be released today.     The pilots earlier this week offered to buy the airline for 2.3 billion dlrs, and assume 2.2 billion dlrs of existing debt.     Takeover speculation has driven UAL's stock for several weeks. UAL last month said New York Real estate developer Donald Trump held a position in its stock, and that he also held discussions with its chairman.     The developer indicated in those talks that he took the position as an investment, but he revealed no other plans.     Today, rumors circulated that Coniston Partners were buying UAL stock. UAL jumped five to 70-3/4 on volume of more than 3.2 mln shares.     "United has got to consider this proposal. I think the pilot's proposal is realistic. I don't exptect them to take it, but it could put some interesting options in front of UAL management," said Timothy Pettee, Bear Stearns and co analyst.     Analysts have said UAL made itself vulnerable to attack when it diversified away from its core airline. It added Hertz rental cars, Westin and Hilton International hotels in a strategy to become a travel service company.     The strategy left its stock in a slump and its pilots union concerned that the company was not focussing enough attention on its airline.     UAL has stood firm on its strategy. It is emphasizing its new focus by changing its name to Allegis, as of May one.     But takeover speculation has escalated, and Wall Street has been busy calculating break up values well in excess of 100 dlrs per share. Traders today described the buying in UAL as widespread, indicative to them that big institutions believe the stock is in play.     Market sources have said that although Trump attracted attention to the stock, the pilots proposal acted as a catalyst, kicking off a new round of speculation and perhaps throwing the company into the hands of another buyer.     "The first domino is you have an investor with a considerable stake. the second domino is the union. That type of attitude has been a precursor to airline deals in the past," said Pettee.     "What's interesting is the values are there. There's something for everybody," he said.   Reuter &#3;
earn	HARTMARX &lt;HMX> TARGETS EARNINGS GROWTH .  Hartmarx Corp, following a year of restructuring, continues to target record earnings for fiscal 1987, Chairman John Meinert told the annual meeting.     Meinert reiterated an earlier comment that earnings for the remainder of the year must double the 1986 level to meet that goal. In fiscal 1986, ended November 30, 1986, Hartmarx reported earnings of 24.8 mln dlrs, or 1.20 dlrs a share, down from the prior year's 42.7 mln dlrs, or 2.25 dlrs a share.     The 110-year-old apparel manufacturer recently posted first-quarter earnings of 54 cts a share, up from 40 cts a year ago.     Meinert told shareholders Hartmarx has no plans to sell any of its divisions. He added, "We have the financial capacity to take advantage of acquisitions."     In 1987, Meinert said the company will open five new and 10 redesigned Kuppenheimer direct-to-consumer stores in Atlanta, Detroit, St. Louis, Washington, D.C. and San Francisco.     He said the company's women's apparel continues to grow, and Hartmarx has on the drawing board a Briar concept store which will feature ties, shirts and some tailored clothing.  Reuter &#3;

money-supply	FED'S HELLER SAYS MONETARY GROWTH TO BE SLOWER .  Robert Heller, a member of the Federal Reserve Board, said he expects "more modest levels" of growth in the money supply this year.     "In my view, this would not only be a logical, but also a most desireable development," he said in a speech prepared for delivery to an economic forum at Chapman College in Orange, Calif.     A text was released in Washington.     He said the effect of lower inflation and financial deregulation on monetary aggregates was now largely finished.     "Consequently, monetary growth may return to more modest levels," Heller said. He noted growth in the money supply slowed after mid-January.     "I would not be surprised at all if the monetary aggregates were to grow rather slowly during the balance of the year as well," he added.     Heller said there was a danger of renewed price inflation.     "The pricing behavior of American producers in response to price increases of their foreign competitors will be crucial for our economic future," he said.     Widespread domestic price rises in response to rising import prices would "generalize the inflationary forces emanating from the foreign trade sector" and might not gain more market share for U.S. producers.     "A return to the stagflation of the late 1970s may well be the result of such a behavior pattern," Heller warned.     He said "we at the Federal Reserve will have to be disciplined in our conduct of monetary policy."      Heller said said the government should also exercise fiscal discipline and cut the deficit by spending restraint rather than new taxes.     "The imposition of new taxes would tend to rekindle inflation and certainly would not make us more competitive in international markets," Heller said.     He said the U.S. economy should expand by nearly three pct during 1987, aided by higher exports to Europe and Canada.     A free trade agreement currently being negotiated with Canada "would be exceedingly helpful in allowing American producers to compete more effectively in that country," Heller said.  Reuter &#3;

cocoa	BAHIA COCOA REVIEW .  Showers continued throughout the week in the Bahia cocoa zone, alleviating the drought since early January and improving prospects for the coming temporao, although normal humidity levels have not been restored, Comissaria Smith said in its weekly review.     The dry period means the temporao will be late this year.     Arrivals for the week ended February 22 were 155,221 bags of 60 kilos making a cumulative total for the season of 5.93 mln against 5.81 at the same stage last year. Again it seems that cocoa delivered earlier on consignment was included in the arrivals figures.     Comissaria Smith said there is still some doubt as to how much old crop cocoa is still available as harvesting has practically come to an end. With total Bahia crop estimates around 6.4 mln bags and sales standing at almost 6.2 mln there are a few hundred thousand bags still in the hands of farmers, middlemen, exporters and processors.     There are doubts as to how much of this cocoa would be fit for export as shippers are now experiencing dificulties in obtaining +Bahia superior+ certificates.     In view of the lower quality over recent weeks farmers have sold a good part of their cocoa held on consignment.     Comissaria Smith said spot bean prices rose to 340 to 350 cruzados per arroba of 15 kilos.     Bean shippers were reluctant to offer nearby shipment and only limited sales were booked for March shipment at 1,750 to 1,780 dlrs per tonne to ports to be named.     New crop sales were also light and all to open ports with June/July going at 1,850 and 1,880 dlrs and at 35 and 45 dlrs under New York july, Aug/Sept at 1,870, 1,875 and 1,880 dlrs per tonne FOB.     Routine sales of butter were made. March/April sold at 4,340, 4,345 and 4,350 dlrs.     April/May butter went at 2.27 times New York May, June/July at 4,400 and 4,415 dlrs, Aug/Sept at 4,351 to 4,450 dlrs and at 2.27 and 2.28 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 4,480 dlrs and 2.27 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.     Destinations were the U.S., Covertible currency areas, Uruguay and open ports.     Cake sales were registered at 785 to 995 dlrs for March/April, 785 dlrs for May, 753 dlrs for Aug and 0.39 times New York Dec for Oct/Dec.     Buyers were the U.S., Argentina, Uruguay and convertible currency areas.     Liquor sales were limited with March/April selling at 2,325 and 2,380 dlrs, June/July at 2,375 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York July, Aug/Sept at 2,400 dlrs and at 1.25 times New York Sept and Oct/Dec at 1.25 times New York Dec, Comissaria Smith said.     Total Bahia sales are currently estimated at 6.13 mln bags against the 1986/87 crop and 1.06 mln bags against the 1987/88 crop.     Final figures for the period to February 28 are expected to be published by the Brazilian Cocoa Trade Commission after carnival which ends midday on February 27.  Reuter &#3;

Ohio Mattress Co said its first quarter, ending February 28, profits may be below the 2.4 mln dlrs, or 15 cts a share, earned in the first quarter of fiscal 1986.     The company said any decline would be due to expenses related to the acquisitions in the middle of the current quarter of seven licensees of Sealy Inc, as well as 82 pct of the outstanding capital stock of Sealy.     Because of these acquisitions, it said, first quarter sales will be substantially higher than last year's 67.1 mln dlrs.     Noting that it typically reports first quarter results in late march, said the report is likely to be issued in early April this year.

Dean Foods Co expects earnings for the fourth quarter ending May 30 to exceed those of the same year-ago period, Chairman Kenneth Douglas told analysts.     In the fiscal 1986 fourth quarter the food processor reported earnings of 40 cts a share.     Douglas also said the year's sales should exceed 1.4 billion dlrs, up from 1.27 billion dlrs the prior year.     He repeated an earlier projection that third-quarter earnings "will probably be off slightly" from last year's 40 cts a share, falling in the range of 34 cts to 36 cts a share.     Douglas said it was too early to project whether the anticipated fourth quarter performance would be "enough for us to exceed the prior year's overall earnings" of 1.53 dlrs a share.     In 1988, Douglas said Dean should experience "a 20 pct improvement in our bottom line from effects of the tax reform act alone."     President Howard Dean said in fiscal 1988 the company will derive  benefits of various dairy and frozen vegetable acquisitions from Ryan Milk to the Larsen Co.     Dean also said the company will benefit from its acquisition in late December of Elgin Blenders Inc, West Chicago.     He said the company is a major shareholder of E.B.I.

Brown-Forman said nine month profits declined a bit to 66.0 mln dlrs, or 3.07 dlrs a share, from 66.2 mln dlrs, or 3.08 dlrs a share, a year earlier due to a second quarter charge of 37 cts a share for restructuring its beverage operations.

ChemLawn Corp &lt;CHEM> could attract a higher bid than the 27 dlrs per share offered by Waste Management Inc &lt;WNX>, Wall Street arbitrageurs said.     Shares of ChemLawn shot up 11-5/8 to 29-3/8 in over-the-counter- trading with 3.8 mln of the company's 10.1 mln shares changing hands by late afternoon.     "This company could go for 10 times cash flow or 30 dlrs, maybe 32 dollars depending on whether there is a competing bidder," an arbitrageur said. Waste Management's tender offer, announced before the opening today, expires March 25.     "This is totally by surprise," said Debra Strohmaier, a ChemLawn spokeswoman. The company's board held a regularly scheduled meeting today and was discussing the Waste Management announcement. She said a statement was expected but it was not certain when it would be ready.      She was unable to say if there had been any prior contact between Waste Management and ChemLawn officials.     "I think they will resist it," said Elliott Schlang, analyst at Prescott, Ball and Turben Inc. "Any company that doesn't like a surprise attack would."     Arbitrageurs pointed out it is difficult to resist tender offers for any and all shares for cash. Schlang said ChemLawn could try to find a white knight if does not want to be acquired by Waste Management.     Analyst Rosemarie Morbelli of Ingalls and Snyder said ServiceMaster Companies L.P. &lt;SVM> or Rollins Inc &lt;ROL> were examples of companies that could be interested.     ChemLawn, with about two mln customers, is the largest U.S. company involved in application of fertilizers, pesticides and herbicides on lawns. Waste Management is involved in removal of wastes.     Schlang said ChemLawn's customer base could be valuable to another company that wants to capitalize on a strong residential and commercial distribution system.     Both Schlang and Morbelli noted that high growth rates had catapulted ChemLawn's share price into the mid-30's in 1983 but the stock languished as the rate of growth slowed.     Schlang said the company's profits are concentrated in the fourth quarter. In 1986 ChemLawn earned 1.19 dlrs per share for the full year, and 2.58 dlrs in the fourth quarter.     Morbelli noted ChemLawn competes with thousands of individual entrepreuers who offer lawn and garden care sevice.  Reuter &#3;

trade	BRAZIL ANTI-INFLATION PLAN LIMPS TO ANNIVERSARY .  inflation plan, initially hailed at home and abroad as the saviour of the economy, is limping towards its first anniversary amid soaring prices, widespread shortages and a foreign payments crisis.     Announced last February 28 the plan froze prices, fixed the value of the new Cruzado currency and ended widespread indexation of the economy in a bid to halt the country's 250 pct inflation rate.     But within a year the plan has all but collapsed.     "The situation now is worse than it was. Although there was inflation, at least the economy worked," a leading bank economist said.     The crumbling of the plan has been accompanied by a dramatic reversal in the foreign trade account. In 1984 and 1985 Brazil's annual trade surpluses had been sufficient to cover the 12 billion dlrs needed to service its 109 billion dlr foreign debt.     For the first nine months of 1986 all seemed to be on target for a repeat, with monthly surpluses averaging one billion dlrs. But as exports were diverted and imports increased to avoid further domestic shortages the trade surplus plunged to 211 mln dlrs in October and since then has averaged under 150 mln.  Reuter &#3;

U.S. bank discount window borrowings less extended credits averaged 310 mln dlrs in the week to Wednesday February 25, the Federal Reserve said.     The Fed said that overall borrowings in the week fell 131 mln dlrs to 614 mln dlrs, with extended credits up 10 mln dlrs at 304 mln dlrs. The week was the second half of a two-week statement period. Net borrowings in the prior week averaged 451 mln dlrs.     Commenting on the two-week statement period ended February 25, the Fed said that banks had average net free reserves of 644 mln dlrs a day, down from 1.34 billion two weeks earlier.     A Federal Reserve spokesman told a press briefing that there were no large single day net misses in the Fed's reserve projections in the week to Wednesday.     He said that natural float had been "acting a bit strangely" for this time of year, noting that there had been poor weather during the latest week.     The spokesman said that natural float ranged from under 500 mln dlrs on Friday, for which he could give no reason, to nearly one billion dlrs on both Thursday and Wednesday.     The Fed spokeman could give no reason for Thursday's high float, but he said that about 750 mln dlrs of Wednesday's float figure was due to holdover and transportation float at two widely separated Fed districts.     For the week as a whole, he said that float related as of adjustments were "small," adding that they fell to a negative 750 mln dlrs on Tuesday due to a number of corrections for unrelated cash letter errors in six districts around the country.     The spokesman said that on both Tuesday and Wednesday, two different clearing banks had system problems and the securities and Federal funds wires had to be held open until about 2000 or 2100 EST on both days.     However, he said that both problems were cleared up during both afternoons and there was no evidence of any reserve impact.     During the week ended Wednesday, 45 pct of net discount window borrowings were made by the smallest banks, with 30 pct by the 14 large money center banks and 25 pct by large regional institutions.     On Wednesday, 55 pct of the borrowing was accounted for by the money center banks, with 30 pct by the large regionals and 15 pct by the smallest banks.     The Fed spokesman said the banking system had excess reserves on Thursday, Monday and Tuesday and a deficit on Friday and Wedndsday. That produced a small daily average deficit for the week as a whole.     For the two-week period, he said there were relatively high excess reserves on a daily avearge, almost all of which were at the smallest banks.  Reuter &#3;
acq	AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP> SEEN IN POSSIBLE SPINNOFF .  American Express Co remained silent on market rumors it would spinoff all or part of its Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc, but some analysts said the company may be considering such a move because it is unhappy with the market value of its stock.     American Express stock got a lift from the rumor, as the market calculated a partially public Shearson may command a good market value, thereby boosting the total value of American Express. The rumor also was accompanied by talk the financial services firm would split its stock and boost its dividend.     American Express closed on the New York Stock Exchange at 72-5/8, up 4-1/8 on heavy volume.     American Express would not comment on the rumors or its stock activity.     Analysts said comments by the company at an analysts' meeting Tuesday helped fuel the rumors as did an announcement yesterday of management changes.     At the meeting, company officials said American Express stock is undervalued and does not fully reflect the performance of Shearson, according to analysts.     Yesterday, Shearson said it was elevating its chief operating officer, Jeffery Lane, to the added position of president, which had been vacant. It also created four new positions for chairmen of its operating divisions.     Analysts speculated a partial spinoff would make most sense, contrary to one variation on market rumors of a total spinoff.     Some analysts, however, disagreed that any spinoff of Shearson would be good since it is a strong profit center for American Express, contributing about 20 pct of earnings last year.     "I think it is highly unlikely that American Express is going to sell shearson," said Perrin Long of Lipper Analytical. He questioned what would be a better investment than "a very profitable securities firm."     Several analysts said American Express is not in need of cash, which might be the only reason to sell a part of a strong asset.     But others believe the company could very well of considered the option of spinning out part of Shearson, and one rumor suggests selling about 20 pct of it in the market.     Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities said he believes American Express could have considered a partial spinoff in the past.     "Shearson being as profitable as it is would have fetched a big premium in the market place. Shearson's book value is in the 1.4 mln dlr range. Shearson in the market place would probably be worth three to 3.5 bilion dlrs in terms of market capitalization," said Eckenfelder.     Some analysts said American Express could use capital since it plans to expand globally.     "They have enormous internal growth plans that takes capital. You want your stock to reflect realistic valuations to enhance your ability to make all kinds of endeavors down the road," said E.F. Hutton Group analyst Michael Lewis.     "They've outlined the fact that they're investing heavily in the future, which goes heavily into the international arena," said Lewis. "...That does not preclude acquisitions and divestitures along the way," he said.     Lewis said if American Express reduced its exposure to the brokerage business by selling part of shearson, its stock might better reflect other assets, such as the travel related services business.     "It could find its true water mark with a lesser exposure to brokerage. The value of the other components could command a higher multiple because they constitute a higher percentage of the total operating earnings of the company," he said.      Lewis said Shearson contributed 316 mln in after-tax operating earnings, up from about 200 mln dlrs in 1985.      Reuter &#3;

Earlier, Coleco reported a net loss of 111.2 mln dlrs for the year ended December 31 compared to a profit of 64.2 mln dlrs in the year earlier.     In a prepared statement, the company said the dramatic swing in operating results was due primarily to the steep decline in sales of Cabbage Patch Kids products from 600 mln dlrs to 230 mln dlrs.     Coleco said it changed from a single product company to a more diversified organization through four major acquisitions last year.     Products from the new acquisitions and other new product introductions are expected to enable it to return to profitability, it said.

grain	GAO LIKELY TO SHOW CERTS MORE COSTLY THAN CASH .  A study on grain certificates due out shortly from the Government Accounting Office (GAO) could show that certificates cost the government 10 to 15 pct more than cash outlays, administration and industry sources said.     Analysis that the GAO has obtained from the Agriculture Department and the Office of Management and Budget suggests that certificates cost more than cash payments, a GAO official told Reuters.     GAO is preparing the certificate study at the specific request of Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.), former chairman of the senate agriculture committee.     The report, which will focus on the cost of certificates compared to cash, is scheduled to be released in mid March.     The cost of certificates, said the GAO source, depends on the program's impact on the USDA loan program.     If GAO determines that certificates encourage more loan entries or cause more loan forfeitures, then the net cost of the program would go up. However, if it is determined that certificates have caused the government grain stockpile to decrease, the cost effect of certificates would be less.     GAO will not likely suggest whether the certificates program should be slowed or expanded, the GAO official said.     But a negative report on certificates "will fuel the fire against certificates and weigh heavily on at least an increase in the certificate program," an agricultural consultant said.     The OMB is said to be against any expansion of the program, while USDA remains firmly committed to it.  Reuter &#3;

crude	OPEC MAY HAVE TO MEET TO FIRM PRICES - ANALYSTS .  OPEC may be forced to meet before a scheduled June session to readdress its production cutting agreement if the organization wants to halt the current slide in oil prices, oil industry analysts said.     "The movement to higher oil prices was never to be as easy as OPEC thought. They may need an emergency meeting to sort out the problems," said Daniel Yergin, director of Cambridge Energy Research Associates, CERA.     Analysts and oil industry sources said the problem OPEC faces is excess oil supply in world oil markets.     "OPEC's problem is not a price problem but a production issue and must be addressed in that way," said Paul Mlotok, oil analyst with Salomon Brothers Inc.     He said the market's earlier optimism about OPEC and its ability to keep production under control have given way to a pessimistic outlook that the organization must address soon if it wishes to regain the initiative in oil prices.     But some other analysts were uncertain that even an emergency meeting would address the problem of OPEC production above the 15.8 mln bpd quota set last December.     "OPEC has to learn that in a buyers market you cannot have deemed quotas, fixed prices and set differentials," said the regional manager for one of the major oil companies who spoke on condition that he not be named. "The market is now trying to teach them that lesson again," he added.     David T. Mizrahi, editor of Mideast reports, expects OPEC to meet before June, although not immediately. However, he is not optimistic that OPEC can address its principal problems.     "They will not meet now as they try to take advantage of the winter demand to sell their oil, but in late March and April when demand slackens," Mizrahi said.     But Mizrahi said that OPEC is unlikely to do anything more than reiterate its agreement to keep output at 15.8 mln bpd."     Analysts said that the next two months will be critical for OPEC's ability to hold together prices and output.     "OPEC must hold to its pact for the next six to eight weeks since buyers will come back into the market then," said Dillard Spriggs of Petroleum Analysis Ltd in New York.     But Bijan Moussavar-Rahmani of Harvard University's Energy and Environment Policy Center said that the demand for OPEC oil has been rising through the first quarter and this may have prompted excesses in its production.     "Demand for their (OPEC) oil is clearly above 15.8 mln bpd and is probably closer to 17 mln bpd or higher now so what we are seeing characterized as cheating is OPEC meeting this demand through current production," he told Reuters in a telephone interview.

nat-gas	LNG IMPORTS FROM ALGERIA UNLIKELY IN 1987 .  Liquefied natural gas imports from Algeria are unlikely to happen in 1987 even though its economically feasible, U.S. industry analysts sources said.     Youcef Yousfi, director-general of Sonatrach, the Algerian state petroleum agency, indicated in a television interview in Algiers that such imports would be made this year.     "Contract negotiations, filing with the U.S. government and the time required to restart mothballed terminals will delay the import until 1988/1989," Daniel Tulis, a natural gas analyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. said.     Sonatrach is currently negotiating with two of its former customers, Panhandle Eastern &lt;PEL> and Distrigas, a subsidiary of Cabot Corp &lt;CBT> to resume LNG export, company officials told Reuters. A third, El Paso Gas, a subsidiary of Burlington Northern &lt;BNI>, has expressed no interest.     Industry analysts said some imports of Algerian LNG were feasible. "On a marginal cost basis, the companies that have made capital investment to handle LNG import can operate profitably even in the current price environment,"  Frank Spadine, an energy economist with Bankers Trust, said.    Analysts did not forsee a major impact from Algerian imports on U.S. prices which are currently soft but expected to trend higher by the end of 1987.     A decline in gas drilling and the time lag to bring Gulf of Mexico productions onstream will tighten gas supplies and firm prices, Shearson's Tulis said.    In this context, Algerian LNG import would be a source of supplemental supply to U.S. domestic production, he added.     Company sources currently in talks with Algeria agree, saying that Algerian LNG would only serve to meet peak demand.     Company sources also said that any negotiations with Algeria would emphasize looser arrangements which would relate volumes to market requirements and prices to U.S. spot market values.  Reuter &#3;
cpi,gnp	SWISS ECONOMY IN EXCELLENT CONDITION, OECD SAYS .  Switzerland's economy, combining low unemployment, financial stability and a large external payments surplus, is in excellent condition and faces a satisfactory future, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development, OECD, said.     This reflected the success of stable and relatively tight fiscal and monetary policies followed by the government, it said.     The OECD, in its annual report on Switzerland, picked out some signs of a slowdown in activity and a slight pick-up in inflation this year, but said these gave no cause for concern.     The study forecast a decline in Gross Domestic Product growth to 1.75 pct this year from an estimated two pct in 1986 and a small rise in consumer price inflation to 1.25 pct after last year's sharp fall to 0.75 pct from 3.6 pct in 1985.     But it said job creation should continue to absorb a modest increase in the workforce, leaving the unemployment rate unchanged at around one pct, the lowest in the 24-industrial nation OECD area.     Assuming an average exchange rate of 1.71 Swiss francs to the dollar this year, against 1.69 in the second half of 1986, the report forecast a 2.75 pct rise in exports and a 3.5 pct rise in imports this year after rises of 3.25 pct and 6.5 pct respectively in 1986.     The faster growth of imports compared with exports this year and last, reflecting buoyant private consumption, meant that the contribution of the foreign payments balance to GDP would shrink in both years.     But "given Switzerland's large external surplus, there should be no concern if domestic demand grows faster than GDP...Which, if only in a small way, would contribute to improving international balances," the OECD said.     Real private consumption appeared to have been unusually buoyant last year, with a 3.25 pct growth rate, after several years of relative weakness, it noted.     In 1987 private consumption was expected to slow somewhat to a 2.25 pct growth rate, but should still outstrip overall GDP, it added.     The outlook for investment in plant and machinery remained bright into 1987, and with capacity use at near record levels last year there was scope for rationalisation and modernisation in both the industry and service sectors, it said.     As a consequence, growth in machinery and equipment investment is likely to decelerate only slightly this year after vigorous growth in 1986.     But the report raised a questionmark over the prospects for tourism and the banking industry, two major service sector earners of foreign exchange.     The long-term appreciation of the Swiss Franc, and the accelerating deregulation of foreign banking markets, could lead to a loss of international market share for both, it said.     Particularly for the banks, "recent developments in international financial markets give rise to the question whether the Swiss financial system, which has shown substantial flexibility in the past, is adapting itself at the speed required ... To preserve its competitive position," it said.  REUTER &#3;
grain,wheat	U.S. WHEAT BONUS TO SOVIET CALLED DORMANT .  The U.S. Agriculture Department is not actively considering offering subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union under the export enhancement program (EEP), senior USDA officials said.     However, grain trade analysts said the proposal has not been ruled out and that an offer might be made, though not in the very near future.     "The grain companies are trying to get this fired up again," an aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said. "But there just isn't much talk about it, informally or formally."     Most analysts interviewed by Reuters were more confident than USDA officials that bonus wheat would be offered to the Soviets, even though U.S. officials did not make such an offer when they held grain talks with Soviet counterparts earlier this week.     But administration and private sources agreed that if the Reagan administration did decide to offer subsidized wheat to Moscow, it could take several months.     "I just don't see any proposal like that sailing through any interagency process," the aide to Lyng said.     "An export enhancement offer is not consummated overnight," said one former USDA official, who noted that the administration took three months to decide in favor of selling China wheat under the subsidy program.     An official representing a large grain trade company said deliberations within USDA might be nudged along by members of Congress, a number of whom urged USDA this week to make a wheat subsidy offer to the Soviets.     But Lyng's aide said that during a day-long visit to Capitol Hill yesterday, House members did not press the secretary on the subsidy question a single time.     The administration's interagency trade policy review group, comprised of subcabinet-level officials, has not been asked to clear a request to offer Moscow wheat under the EEP, officials at the U.S. Trade Representative's Office said.     In their talks this week, the two sides discussed the administration's previous EEP offer but did not talk about any new initiative. One USDA official who took part in the consultations this week described them as an exchange of "calm, basic, factual economics."     Another USDA official said there was "not even an informal suggestion or hint" that the Soviets would live up to their pledge to buy four mln tonnes of wheat this year if they were granted more favorable terms.     USDA and private sources agreed that consideration of an EEP initiative by interagency review groups likely would be delayed because of disarray within the White House stemming from the Iran arms affair.

veg-oil,oilseed,meal-feed,soybean,soy-oil,soy-meal	FALLING SOYBEAN CRUSH RATIOS CUT OUTPUT .  The sharp decline in soybean crush ratios seen in the last few weeks, accelerating in recent days, has pushed margins below the cost of production at most soybean processing plants and prompted many to cut output of soybean meal and oil.     The weekly U.S. soybean crush rate was reported by the National Soybean Processors Association this afternoon at 21.78 mln bushels, down from the 22 mln bushel plus rate seen over the past two months when crush margins surged to the best levels seen in over a year.     Active soymeal export loadings at the Gulf had pushed soybean futures and premiums higher, prompting a pick-up in the weekly crush number.     However, much of that export demand seems to have been met, with most foreign meal users now waiting for the expected surge in shipments of new crop South American soymeal over the next few months.     U.S. processors are now finding domestic livestock feed demand is very light for this time of year due to the milder than normal winter, so they steadily dropped offering prices in an attempt to find buying interest, soyproduct dealers said.     Soybean meal futures have also steadily declined in recent weeks, setting a new contract low of 139.70 dlrs per ton in the nearby March contract today.     "Many speculators down here bought March soymeal and sold May, looking for no deliveries (on first notice day tomorrow, which would cause March to gain on deferreds)," one CBT crush trader said.     "But they've been bailing out this week because the March has been acting like there will be a lot delivered, if not tomorrow, then later in the month," he added.     As a result of the weakness in soymeal, the March crush ratio (The value of soyproducts less the cost of the soybeans) fell from the mid 30s earlier this month to 22.6 cents per bushel today, dropping over five cents in just the last two days.     The May crush ended today just over 17 cents, so no processors will want to lock in a ratio at that unprofitable level, the trader said. Hopefully, they will now start to cut back production to get supplies in line with demand, he added.     With futures down, processors are finding they must bid premiums for cash soybeans, further reducing crush margins.     A central Illinois processor is only making about 30 cents for every bushel of soybeans crushed at current prices, down sharply from levels just seen just a few weeks ago and below the average cost of production, cash dealers said.     Most soybean processing plants are still in operation, with little talk of taking temporary down-time, so far. But processors will start halting production in the next few weeks it they continue to face unprofitable margins, they added.  Reuter &#3;

money-supply	FED DATA SUGGEST STABLE U.S. MONETARY POLICY .  Latest Federal Reserve data suggest that the central bank voted to maintain the existing degree of pressure on banking reserves at its regular policy-making meeting two weeks ago, money market economists said.     "The numbers were a little disappointing, but I think we can take Mr Volcker at his word when he said that nothing had changed," said Bob Bannon of Security Pacific National Bank.     Fed Chairman Paul Volcker told a Congressional committee last Thursday that the Fed's policy "has been unchanged up to today."     Although Volcker's statement last Thursday allayed most fears that the Fed had marginally tightened its grip on reserves to help an ailing dollar, many economists still wanted confirmation of a steady policy in today's data, which covered the two-week bank statement period ended yesterday.     This need for additional reassurance was made all the more acute by the Fed's decision yesterday to drain reserves from the banking system by arranging overnight matched sale-purchase agreements for the first time since April of last year, economists added.     Today's data showed that the draining action was for a fairly large 3.9 billion dlrs, economists said.     "The one thing that caught my eye were the relatively sizeable matched sales on Wednesday," said Dana Johnson of First National Bank of Chicago. "But there was a clearly justified need for them. There was nothing ominous."     "The Fed couldn't have waited until the start of the new statement period today. If it had, it would have missed its (reserve) projections," added Security Pacific's Bannon.     A Fed spokesman told reporters that there were no large single-day net miss in reserve projections in the latest week.     Economists similarly shrugged off slightly higher-than- expected adjusted bank borrowings from the Fed's discount window, which averaged 310 mln dlrs a day in the latest week, compared with many economists' forecasts of about 200 mln.     For the two-week bank statement period as a whole, the daily borrowing average more than doubled to 381 mln dlrs from 160 in the prior period.     "There were wire problems at two large banks on Tuesday and Wednesday, so I am not too bothered about the borrowings," said Scott Winningham of J.S. Winningham and Co. The Wednesday average rose to 946 mln dlrs from 148 mln a week earlier.     Lending further support to the stable policy view was a relatively steady federal funds rate of about six pct in the latest week and persistently high levels of excess reserves in the banking system, economists said.     "For the time being, the Fed is following a neutral path, with fed funds at about six to 6-1/8 pct," said Darwin Beck of First Boston Corp. "I expect it to continue in that vein."     "Excess reserves fell but they are still over a billion dlrs," added First Chicago's Johnson. Banks' excess reserves averaged 1.03 billion dlrs a day in the latest statement period, down from 1.50 billion in the previous one.     After the Fed declined to assign a 1987 target growth range to the wayward M-1 money supply measure last week, little attention was paid to a steeper-than-anticipated 2.1 billion dlr jump in the week ended February 16.     Looking ahead, economists said the Fed will have to tread a fine line between the dollar's progress in the international currency markets and the development of the domestic economy.     "The market has perhaps exaggerated the dollar's effect on Fed policy," said First Chicago's Johnson. "Of course, it will take the dollar into account in future policy decisions but if the economy is weak, it won't pull back from easing."  Reuter &#3;
cpi,gnp	FRANCE FACES PRESSUE TO CHANGE POLICIES .  France's right wing government is facing growing pressure to modify its economic policies after revising down its 1987 growth targets and revising up its inflation forecasts for this year.     Moving reluctantly into line with most private sector forecasts the government yesterday raised its 1987 inflation estimate a half percentage point to 2.5 per cent and cut its economic growth estimate to between two and 2.8 per cent from a 2.8 per cent target written into the annual budget last september.     Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said the revised figures would not push the government off its chosen mix of price deregulation, budget-cutting rigour and pay restraint.     But Trade Union leaders served immediate notice they would push to protect the purchasing power of their members, raising the spectre of a vicious spiral of wage and price rises.     And bank economists contacted by Reuters said they believed Prime Minister Jacques Chirac could be forced by slow growth and rising unemployment to reflate the economy later this year, perhaps in the autumn, to boost his prospects in Presidential elections due by April 1988.     "The outlook is more worrying than it was a few weeks ago," said Societe Generale economist Alain Marais. "We have the impression it may be difficult to get even two per cent growth this year."     "The big question is whether the government's policy of wage moderation will be maintained," he added.     The government has set public sector wage rises at aboout 1.7 per cent this year, with a three per cent ceiling for rises justified by increased productivity.     But the head of the socialist CFDT union federation, Edmond Maire, meeting with Chirac today, renewed union demands already rejected by the government for indexation clauses to be built into future pay contracts to safeguard workers against higher prices.     Calling the government's policies "unbalanced and unjust," he also demanded investment incentives to boost employment. He announced after his meeting that Chirac had told him the government would spend two billion francs on a series of measures to boost employment and training     Andre Bergeron, a widely respected leader of the moderate Force Ouvriere labour group, put similar demands to Chirac earlier in the week while the Communist-led CGT, the largest of France's unions, declared the defence of its members earnings its top priority.     But with unemployment nearing 11 per cent last month, and still rising, government supporters and some economic analysts said they were confident Chirac could resist union pay demands.     "Salary indexation was ended by the previous Socialist government and I dont think this administration is going to reverse that," commented Michel Develle, economist at recently-privatised Banque Paribas.     Damaging transport and electricity strikes over Christmas and the New Year, partly blamed by the government for higher inflation, had undermined the unions power and popularity, he said.     Develle said Paribas expected inflation to rise even more than the governments revised forecast, perhaps to 2.6 or 2.7 per cent this year against last years 2.1 per cent.     "But that would still be an exceptional achievement considering that for the first time since the Second World War all french prices have been freed," he commented.     Finance Ministry officials said that the governments abolition of price and rent controls last year was responsible for nearly a quarter of a 0.9 per cent surge in January living costs.     But they claimed it was a once-off phenomenon that should have no knock-on impact on the rest of the year.     Both Marais and Develle said they agreed with that, so long as the government kept wages under control.     Prices could rise 1.5 per cent in the first three months of 1987 and two per cent in the first half year, fractionally more than forecast this week by the National Statistics Institute, INSEE,  Marais said. But the second half year should be better, he added.     Ironically, one side effect of higher inflation could be to help the government achieve its aim of cutting the state budget deficit, several analysts said.     So long as public sector wages are held down, higher Value Added Tax receipts resulting from rising prices should offset a loss in revenues that otherwise would result from slower than expected growth, they said.

money-supply	N.Z. CENTRAL BANK SEES SLOWER MONEY, CREDIT GROWTH .  Monetary and credit growth rates in New Zealand are not expected to continue at current levels following the Reserve Bank's move to tighten liquidity late last year, Reserve Bank Governor Spencer Russell said.     The monetary and credit growth figures for the December quarter were probably artifically inflated by unusually high growth in inter-institutional lending activity on the short term money market, Russell said in a statement.     The bank moved to tighten liquidity when the initial signs of the recent expansion became apparent in September and October last year, Russell said.     Broadly defined M-3 figures released today showed growth of 17.8 pct in the year ended December compared with 13.1 pct in the year ended September.     Annual growth of private sector credit in calendar 1986 was 30.7 pct compared with 16.5 pct in the September year.     "Available evidence suggests that corporate customers, including non-bank financial institutions, have been exploiting differences between interest rates on overdrafts with trading banks and rates in the call market," Russell said.

interest	JAPAN EXPECTED TO CUT BASE RATE FOR STATE BODIES .  Japan is expected to cut the base lending rate for state financial institutions to 5.5 pct from 6.2 as part of the recent pact by major industrial nations in Paris, Finance Ministry sources said.     They said the cut is based on a revision of the Trust Fund Bureau Law, which should be approved by parliament on March 3, abolishing the 6.05 pct minimum interest rate on deposits with the bureau.     The bureau channels funds to government financial institutions for public works and other official uses, they said.     The base lending rate for state bodies such as the Japan Development Bank, People's Finance Corp and the finance corporations of local public enterprises usually moves in tandem with long-term prime rates, the sources said.     However, it was impossible for them to follow the last cut, to 5.8 pct from 6.2 pct on January 28, because the Trust Fund Bureau rate was legally set at 6.05 pct.     The ministry will abolish the minimum rate and introduce a market-related one to resolve the problem and stimulate the domestic economy, they said.     On Tuesday, the ministry allowed long-term bankers to cut their prime to a record low of 5.5 pct, effective February 28. The move suggested it had reached agreement with depositors using the bureau, the postal savings system of the Posts and Telecommunications Ministry and the Japan welfare annuity of the Ministry of Health and Welfare, the sources said.     These ministries are trying to determine which market rates should be considered when setting the bureau's deposit rate, the ministry sources said.     Coupon rates on new 10-year government bonds, minus 0.1 percentage points, is the likeliest choice, they added.  REUTER &#3;
gnp,bop	AUSTRALIA'S KEATING CHANGES ECONOMIC FORECASTS .  Domestic demand is now expected to make no contribution to Australian economic growth in fiscal 1986/87, ending June 30, while net exports will account for all of the overall increase, Treasurer Paul Keating said here.     However, he did not say in his speech to the Economic Planning Advisory Council (EPAC) if the forecast 2.25 pct rise in gross domestic product (gdp) had been revised.     But Keating said domestic demand could fall slightly this financial year and net export growth will provide the total source of gdp growth.     The August budget had forecast domestic demand would contribute 0.75 percentage points to non-farm gdp growth of 2.5 pct while net exports would account for 1.75 points.     Keating said the overall impact of the changed economic parameters is welcome as it appears to have contributed to a slightly more rapid correction in the current account deficit than first anticipated.     "The government initially forecast a current account deficit for 1986/87 of 14.75 billion -- our present expectation is that the result will be somewhat lower, around 14 billion," he said.     Partial indicators released since the last meeting of EPAC in December indicate that the 1986/87 budget strategy is broadly on track, Keating said.     "They indicate that domestic demand has been a little more sluggish than was expected at budget time," he said.     "On the other hand, net exports seem to be expanding by more than expected at budget time, and this is underpinning growth in domestic production and employment."     Keating said it now seems likely that the 1986/87 inflation rate will exceed the budget forecast of eight pct.     "Nevertheless, there is likely to be a marked slowing in inflation over coming quarters as depreciation and budgetary effects wane," he said.     Keating said the government expects economic growth to pick up moderately in 1987/88 due to a further significant rise in net exports and a very moderate but positive contribution from private domestic demand.     He said domestic demand growth will be due to a strengthening in real household disposable income.     The moderate rise in economic growth next financial year should be sufficient to sustain employment growth at a level broadly equivalent to that of the current fiscal year.     "The current account deficit will continue to show improvement in 1987/88," Keating said.     "As the impact of the exchange rate depreciations of recent years recede further, and given continued effective wage restraint, inflation should moderate markedly in 1987/88," he said.  REUTER &#3;

coffee	PRODUCER SPLIT HEATS UP COFFEE QUOTA TALKS .  Talks on the possibility of reintroducing global coffee export quotas have been extended into today, with sparks flying yesterday when a dissident group of exporters was not included in a key negotiating forum.     The special meeting of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) council was called to find a way to stop a prolonged slide in coffee prices.     However, delegates said no solution to the question of how to implement quotas was yet in sight.     World coffee export quotas -- the major device used to regulate coffee prices under the International Coffee Agreement -- were suspended a year ago when prices soared in reaction to a drought which cut Brazil"s output by nearly two thirds.     Brazil is the world"s largest coffee producer and exporter.     Producers and consumers now are facing off over the question of how quotas should be calculated under any future quota distribution scheme, delegates said.     Tempers flared late Saturday when a minority group of eight producing countries was not represented in a contact group of five producer and five consumer delegates plus alternates which was set up to facilitate debate.     The big producers "want to have the ball only in their court and it isn"t fair," minority producer spokesman Luis Escalante of Costa Rica said.     The majority producer group has proposed resuming quotas April 1, using the previous ad hoc method of carving up quota shares, with a promise to try to negotiate basic quotas before September 30, delegates said.     Their plan would perpetuate the status quo, allowing Brazil to retain almost all of its current 30 pct share of the export market, Colombia 17 pct, Ivory Coast seven pct and Indonesia six pct, with the rest divided among smaller exporters.     But consuming countries and the dissident producer group have tabled separate proposals requiring quotas be determined by availability, using a formula incorporating exportable production and stocks statistics.     Their proposals would give Brazil a smaller quota share and Colombia and Indonesia a larger share, and bring a new quota distribution scheme into effect now rather than later.     Brazil has so far been unwilling to accept any proposal that would reduce its quota share, delegates said.     Delegates would not speculate on prospects for agreement on a quota package. "Anything is possible at this phase," even adjournment of the meeting until March or April, one said.     If the ICO does agree on quotas, the price of coffee on the supermarket shelf is not likely to change sinnificantly as a result, industry sources said.     Retail coffee prices over the past year have remained about steady even though coffee market prices have tumbled, so an upswing probably will not be passed onto the consumer either, they said.

The Italian treasury said annual coupon rates payable March 1988 on two issues of long-term treasury certificates (CCTs) would be cut by about four percentage points compared with rates this March.     Coupon rates on 10-year certificates maturing March 1995 will fall to 9.80 pct from 13.65 pct and rates on 10-year issues maturing in March 1996 would fall to 10.05 pct from 14.30 pct.     The Treasury also cut by 0.60 point six-monthly coupons payable this September on six issues maturing between September 1988 and September 1991.     The issues carry terms of between five and seven years and will have coupon rates of between 4.85 and 5.65 pct in September compared with 5.45 and 6.25 pct this March.  REUTER &#3;

Indonesia"s agriculture sector will grow by just 1.0 pct in calendar 1987, against an estimated 2.4 pct in 1986 as the production of some commodities stagnates or declines, the U.S. Embassy said in a report.     Production of Indonesia"s staple food, rice, is forecast to fall to around 26.3 mln tonnes from an embassy estimate of 26.58 mln tonnes in 1986, according to the annual report on Indonesia"s agricultural performance.     The government officially estimates 1986 rice production at 26.7 mln tonnes, with a forecast 27.3 mln tonnes output in 1987.     The report says wheat imports are likely to fall to 1.5 mln tonnes in calendar 1987 from 1.69 mln tonnes in 1986 because of a drawdown on stocks.     "Growth prospects for agriculture in 1987 do not look promising as rice production is forecast to decline and the production of sugarcane, rubber and copra show little or no gain," the report says.     "The modest overall increase which is expected will be due to significant gains in production of corn soybeans, palm oil and palm kernels."     Constraints to significant overall increases in agricultural output include a shortage of disease resistant seeds, limited fertile land, insect pests and a reluctance by farmers to shift from rice production to other crops, the report underlines.     The fall in rice production is caused by an outbreak of pests known as "wereng" or brown plant hoppers in 1986 which largely offset gains in yields.     The outbreak has forced the government to ban the use of 57 insecticides on rice because it was believed the wereng are now resistant to these varieties, and to use lower-yielding, more resistant rice types.     The government is depending on increased production of export commodities such as coffee, tea, rubber, plywood and palm oil to offset revenue losses brought on by falling crude oil prices.     Palm oil production is expected to increase by over 7.0 pct in 1987 to 1.45 mln tonnes from 1.35 mln, with exports rising to an estimated 720,000 tonnes from 695,000 tonnes in 1986, the report says.     But while production of soybeans in 1987/88 (Oct-Sept) will rise to 1.075 mln tonnes from 980,000 in 1986/87, imports will also rise to supply a new soybean crushing plant.     The report says that imports of wheat, soybeans, soybean meal and cotton are not likely to decline as a result of last September"s 31 pct devaluation of the rupiah because of a rise in domestic demand.     The report said that Indonesia"s overall economic performance in calendar 1986 was about zero or even a slight negative growth rate, the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s. It compares with 1.9 pct growth in 1985 and 6.7 pct in 1984.     The dramatic fall in oil prices last year was responsible for the slump.  REUTER &#3;
crude	KUWAIT SAYS NO PLANS FOR EMERGENCY OPEC TALKS .  Kuwait"s Oil Minister, in remarks published today, said there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review oil policies after recent weakness in world oil prices.     Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah was quoted by the local daily al-Qabas as saying: "None of the OPEC members has asked for such a meeting."     He denied Kuwait was pumping above its quota of 948,000 barrels of crude daily (bpd) set under self-imposed production limits of the 13-nation organisation.     Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above a ceiling of 15.8 mln bpd agreed in Geneva last December.     They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above quota. Kuwait, they said, was pumping 1.2 mln bpd.     "This rumour is baseless. It is based on reports which said Kuwait has the ability to exceed its share. They suppose that because Kuwait has the ability, it will do so," the minister said.     Sheikh Ali has said before that Kuwait had the ability to produce up to 4.0 mln bpd.     "If we can sell more than our quota at official prices, while some countries are suffering difficulties marketing their share, it means we in Kuwait are unusually clever," he said.     He was referring apparently to the Gulf state of qatar, which industry sources said was selling less than 180,000 bpd of its 285,000 bpd quota, because buyers were resisting official prices restored by OPEC last month pegged to a marker of 18 dlrs per barrel.     Prices in New York last week dropped to their lowest levels this year and almost three dollars below a three-month high of 19 dollars a barrel.     Sheikh Ali also delivered "a challenge to any international oil company that declared Kuwait sold below official prices."     Because it was charging its official price, of 16.67 dlrs a barrel, it had lost custom, he said but did not elaborate.     However, Kuwait had guaranteed markets for its oil because of its local and international refining facilities and its own distribution network abroad, he added.     He reaffirmed that the planned meeting March 7 of OPEC"s differentials committee has been postponed until the start of April at the request of certain of the body"s members.     Ecuador"s deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite said last Wednesday his debt-burdened country wanted OPEC to assign a lower official price for its crude, and was to seek this at talks this month of opec"s pricing committee.     Referring to pressure by oil companies on OPEC members, in apparent reference to difficulties faced by Qatar, he said: "We expected such pressure. It will continue through March and April." But he expected the situation would later improve.  REUTER &#3;
crude	INDONESIA SEEN AT CROSSROADS OVER ECONOMIC CHANGE .  Indonesia appears to be nearing a political crossroads over measures to deregulate its protected economy, the U.S. Embassy says in a new report.     To counter falling oil revenues, the government has launched a series of measures over the past nine months to boost exports outside the oil sector and attract new investment.     Indonesia, the only Asian member of OPEC and a leading primary commodity producer, has been severely hit by last year"s fall in world oil prices, which forced it to devalue its currency by 31 pct in September.     But the U.S. Embassy report says President Suharto"s government appears to be divided over what direction to lead the economy.     "(It) appears to be nearing a crossroads with regard to deregulation, both as it pertains to investments and imports," the report says. It primarily assesses Indonesia"s agricultural sector, but also reviews the country"s general economic performance.     It says that while many government officials and advisers are recommending further relaxation, "there are equally strong pressures being exerted to halt all such moves."     "This group strongly favours an import substitution economy," the report says.     Indonesia"s economic changes have been welcomed by the World Bank and international bankers as steps in the right direction, though they say crucial areas of the economy like plastics and steel remain highly protected, and virtual monopolies.     Three sets of measures have been announced since last May, which broadened areas for foreign investment, reduced trade restrictions and liberalised imports.     The report says Indonesia"s economic growth in calendar 1986 was probably about zero, and the economy may even have contracted a bit. "This is the lowest rate of growth since the mid-1960s," the report notes.     Indonesia, the largest country in South-East Asia with a population of 168 million, is facing general elections in April.     But the report hold out little hope for swift improvement in the economic outlook. "For 1987 early indications point to a slightly positive growth rate not exceeding one pct. Economic activity continues to suffer due to the sharp fall in export earnings from the petroleum industry."     "Growth in the non-oil sector is low because of weak domestic demand coupled with excessive plant capacity, real declines in construction and trade, and a reduced level of growth in agriculture," the report states.     Bankers say continuation of present economic reforms is crucial for the government to get the international lending its needs.     A new World Bank loan of 300 mln dlrs last month in balance of payments support was given partly to help the government maintain the momentum of reform, the Bank said.  REUTER &#3;

Traders said they were reluctant to take out new positions amidst uncertainty over whether OPEC will succeed in halting the current decline in oil prices.     Oil industry sources said yesterday several Gulf Arab producers had had difficulty selling oil at official OPEC prices but Kuwait has said there are no plans for an emergency meeting of the 13-member organisation.     A traditional Sunday lull in trading due to the European weekend also contributed to the lack of market activity.

crude	QATAR UNVEILS BUDGET FOR FISCAL 1987/88 .  The Gulf oil state of Qatar, recovering slightly from last year's decline in world oil prices, announced its first budget since early 1985 and projected a deficit of 5.472 billion riyals.     The deficit compared with a shortfall of 7.3 billion riyals in the last published budget for 1985/86.     In a statement outlining the budget for the fiscal year 1987/88 beginning today, Finance and Petroleum Minister Sheikh Abdul-Aziz bin Khalifa al-Thani said the government expected to spend 12.217 billion riyals in the period.     Projected expenditure in the 1985/86 budget had been 15.6 billion riyals.     Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said government revenue would be about 6.745 billion riyals, down by about 30 pct on the 1985/86 projected revenue of 9.7 billion.     The government failed to publish a 1986/87 budget due to uncertainty surrounding oil revenues.     Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said that during that year the government decided to limit recurrent expenditure each month to one-twelfth of the previous fiscal year's allocations minus 15 pct.     He urged heads of government departments and public institutions to help the government rationalise expenditure. He did not say how the 1987/88 budget shortfall would be covered.     Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said plans to limit expenditure in 1986/87 had been taken in order to relieve the burden placed on the country's foreign reserves.     He added in 1987/88 some 2.766 billion riyals had been allocated for major projects including housing and public buildings, social services, health, education, transport and communications, electricity and water, industry and agriculture.     No figure was revealed for expenditure on defence and security. There was also no projection for oil revenue.     Qatar, an OPEC member, has an output ceiling of 285,000 barrels per day.     Sheikh Abdul-Aziz said: "Our expectations of positive signs regarding (oil) price trends, foremost among them OPEC's determination to shoulder its responsibilites and protect its wealth, have helped us make reasonable estimates for the coming year's revenue on the basis of our assigned quota."

money-fx	GULF BOND, STOCK MARKETS LAG BEHIND, GIB SAYS .  Gulf money markets have grown reasonably well during the past decade, but bond and stock markets remain to a large extent fragmented and lag behind, &lt;Gulf International Bank BSC> (GIB) said.     The bank's economist Henry Azzam said in a review of Gulf capital markets that investors have to relinquish traditional investment vehicles such as real estate, foreign currency bank accounts and precious metals.     "Greater financial sophistication is needed coupled with more diversified capital market instruments and a change in the disclosure requirements on company accounts," he said.     The GIB study reviewed capital markets under three categories -- money markets, stock and bond markets.     Azzam said Gulf states had been making greater use of short-term money market instruments and banks in the region had floated various euronotes and underwriting facilities.     "Nevertheless, bond and stock markets remain, to a large extent, fragmented and lagging behind," he said.     Most debt in the region is still raised by syndicated loans and bank facilities and very few companies had made use of stock or bond issues. Only Kuwait has an official stock exchange, while other Gulf nations have yet to establish exchanges.     But with dwindling financial surpluses in the Gulf, governments are actively pursuing ways to develop capital markets and set up domestic stock exchanges, Azzam said.     He said recession stemming from sliding oil prices had "clearly had a negative impact on the development of capital markets in the region."     In addition, family firms are reluctant to go public, financial awareness among investors is still lacking and investment analysis and corporate reporting standards lack depth. A sharp fall in share prices in the early 1980s prompted investors to hold on to shares hoping for an eventual recovery.     Azzam said the absence of proper commercial law in some Gulf countries and authorities' apparent reluctance to adopt financial innovations had also hampered capital markets.     He called for clearly defined laws governing incorporation of joint stock companies and the flotation of debt instruments.     Azzam said capital market instruments should be made available to all citizens and institutions of Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) states -- Bahrain, Kuwait, Qatar, Oman, Saudi Arabia and the United Arab Emirates (UAE). Some moves had been taken in this direction, with Bahrain allowing GCC nationals to own up to 25 pct of locally incorporated companies.     Azzam said Gulf money markets had received greater depth from the introduction of treasury bill offerings in Bahrain and the expansion of securities repurchase regulations in Saudi Arabia.     But he added there is "no bond market to speak of" in Saudi Arabia, Qatar, Oman or the UAE, with the last Saudi riyal denominated bond issued in 1978.     While Bahrain plans an official stock exchange and trading in Saudi Arabia has picked up, establishment of formal exchanges in Qatar, Oman and the UAE does not appear imminent, Azzam said.

crude	SAUDI ARABIA REITERATES COMMITMENT TO OPEC PACT .  Saudi Arabian Oil Minister Hisham Nazer reiterated the kingdom's commitment to last December's OPEC accord to boost world oil prices and stabilise the market, the official Saudi Press Agency SPA said.     Asked by the agency about the recent fall in free market oil prices, Nazer said Saudi Arabia "is fully adhering by the ... Accord and it will never sell its oil at prices below the pronounced prices under any circumstance."     Nazer, quoted by SPA, said recent pressure on free market prices "may be because of the end of the (northern hemisphere) winter season and the glut in the market."     Saudi Arabia was a main architect of the December accord, under which OPEC agreed to lower its total output ceiling by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) and return to fixed prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.     The agreement followed a year of turmoil on oil markets, which saw prices slump briefly to under 10 dlrs a barrel in mid-1986 from about 30 dlrs in late 1985. Free market prices are currently just over 16 dlrs.     Nazer was quoted by the SPA as saying Saudi Arabia's adherence to the accord was shown clearly in the oil market.     He said contacts among members of OPEC showed they all wanted to stick to the accord.     In Jamaica, OPEC President Rilwanu Lukman, who is also Nigerian Oil Minister, said the group planned to stick with the pricing agreement.     "We are aware of the negative forces trying to manipulate the operations of the market, but we are satisfied that the fundamentals exist for stable market conditions," he said.     Kuwait's Oil Minister, Sheikh Ali al-Khalifa al-Sabah, said in remarks published in the emirate's daily Al-Qabas there were no plans for an emergency OPEC meeting to review prices.     Traders and analysts in international oil markets estimate OPEC is producing up to one mln bpd above the 15.8 mln ceiling.     They named Kuwait and the United Arab Emirates, along with the much smaller producer Ecuador, among those producing above quota. Sheikh Ali denied that Kuwait was over-producing.  REUTER &#3;

The International Coffee Organization (ICO ) council talks on reintroducing export quotas continued with an extended session lasting late into Sunday night, but delegates said prospects for an accord between producers and consumers were diminishing by the minute.     The special meeting, called to stop the prolonged slide in coffee prices, was likely to adjourn sometime tonight without agreement, delegates said.     The council is expected to agree to reconvene either within the next six weeks or in September, they said.     The talks foundered on Sunday afternoon when it became apparent consumers and producers could not compromise on the formula for calculating any future quota system, delegates said.     Coffee export quotas were suspended a year ago when prices soared in response to a drought which cut Brazil's crop by nearly two-thirds. Brazil is the world's largest coffee producer and exporter.

Zambia will retain its foreign-exchange auction system despite the suspension of weekly auctions since January 24, President Kenneth Kaunda said.     "We have not run away from the auction. It hasn't been abolished at all," he told Reuters in an interview.     He said the system would be reintroduced after current talks with the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund and, he hoped, would be backed by fresh foreign aid funds.     Kaunda dismissed central bank statements the new auction system would be used to allocate foreign exchange to private bidders but not to fix the exchange rate.     Kaunda said the auction system had faltered because of the government's shortage of foreign exchange to meet demand.     It was suspended when the kwacha's rapid devaluation and strong fluctuations made economic planning almost impossible for the government and the private sector, he said.     Weekly foreign-exchange auctions began in October 1985. The kwacha fell from 2.20 to the dollar to about 15 in 16 months. In January 1987 the government was more than two months in arrears in paying foreign currency to successful bidders, and the auction was suspended and replaced with a fixed exchange rate of nine kwacha to the dollar.

crude	SAUDI FEBRUARY CRUDE OUTPUT PUT AT 3.5 MLN BPD .  Saudi crude oil output last month fell to an average of 3.5 mln barrels per day (bpd) from 3.8 mln bpd in January, Gulf oil sources said.     They said exports from the Ras Tanurah and Ju'aymah terminals in the Gulf fell to an average 1.9 mln bpd last month from 2.2 mln in January because of lower liftings by some customers.     But the drop was much smaller than expected after Gulf exports rallied in the fourth week of February to 2.5 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in the third week, the sources said.     The production figures include neutral zone output but not sales from floating storage, which are generally considered part of a country's output for Opec purposes.     Saudi Arabia has an Opec quota of 4.133 mln bpd under a production restraint scheme approved by the 13-nation group last December to back new official oil prices averaging 18 dlrs a barrel.     The sources said the two-fold jump in exports last week appeared to be the result of buyers rushing to lift February entitlements before the month-end.     Last week's high export levels appeared to show continued support for official Opec prices from Saudi Arabia's main crude customers, the four ex-partners of Aramco, the sources said.     The four -- Exxon Corp &lt;XON>, Mobil Corp &lt;MOB>, Texaco Inc &lt;TX> and Chevron Corp &lt;CHV> -- signed a long-term agreement last month to buy Saudi crude for 17.52 dlrs a barrel.     However the sources said the real test of Saudi Arabia's ability to sell crude at official prices in a weak market will come this month, when demand for petroleum products traditionally tapers off. Spot prices have fallen in recent weeks to more than one dlr below Opec levels.     Saudi Arabian oil minister Hisham Nazer yesterday reiterated the kingdom's commitment to the December OPEC accord and said it would never sell below official prices.     The sources said total Saudi refinery throughput fell slightly in February to an average 1.1 mln bpd from 1.2 mln in January because of cuts at the Yanbu and Jubail export refineries.     They put crude oil exports through Yanbu at 100,000 bpd last month, compared to zero in January, while throughput at Bahrain's refinery and neutral zone production remained steady at around 200,000 bpd each.

veg-oil,palm-oil	INDONESIAN PALM OIL OUTPUT EXPECTED TO RISE .  Indonesia's palm oil output is expected to rise and exports to increase, the U.S. Embassy said in its annual report on Indonesia's agriculture sector.     The Indonesian government said crude palm oil (CPO) output is expected to rise to 1.56 mln tonnes in 1987 and 2.11 mln in 1988, up from a projected 1.45 mln tonnes in 1986 and 1.26 mln in 1985.     The 1986 projection of 1.45 mln tonnes is up from a provisional figure of 1.3 mln tonnes.     A U.S. Embassy assessment puts 1987 output at 1.45 mln tonnes, against 1.35 mln in 1986 and 1.208 mln in 1985.     "More realistic estimates indicate that 1988 production will be between 1.5 and 1.6 mln tonnes," the report said.     The report said the abolition of the five pct CPO export tax, the devaluation of the rupiah in September 1986 and higher international palm oil prices should lead to a modest increase in exports this year.     Exports are forecast to rise to 720,000 tonnes against 695,000 tonnes in 1986, the report added.  REUTER &#3;
tea,cocoa,coffee	INDONESIAN TEA, COCOA EXPORTS SEEN UP, COFFEE DOWN .  Indonesia's exports of tea and cocoa will continue to rise in calendar 1987 but coffee exports are forecast to dip slightly in 1987/88 (April-March) as the government tries to improve quality, the U.S. Embassy said.     The embassy's annual report on Indonesian agriculture forecast coffee output in 1986/87 would be 5.77 mln bags of 60 kilograms each. That is slightly less than the 5.8 mln bags produced in 1985/86.     In 1987/88 coffee production is forecast to rise again to 5.8 mln bags, but exports to dip to 4.8 mln from around 5.0 mln in 1986/87. Exports in 1985/86 were 4.67 mln bags.     The embassy report says coffee stocks will rise to 1.3 mln tonnes in 1987/88 from 1.15 mln in 1986/87. It bases this on a fall in exports as a result of the "probable" re-introduction of quotas by the International Coffee Organisation.     Cocoa production and exports are forecast to rise steadily as the government develops cocoa plantations. Production of cocoa in Indonesia increased to 32,378 tonnes in calendar 1985 from 10,284 tonnes in 1980. It is projected by the government to rise to more than 50,000 tonnes by 1988.     Production in 1986 is estimated by the embassy at 35,000 tonnes, as against 38,000 tonnes in 1987.     The report forecasts cocoa exports to rise to 35,000 tonnes this year, from 33,000 tonnes in 1986 and 31,000 in 1985.     The Netherlands is at present the biggest importer of Indonesian cocoa beans.     The report forecasts that in calendar 1987, Indonesia's CTC (crushed, torn and curled) tea exports will increase significantly with the coming on stream of at least eight new CTC processing plants.     Indonesia plans to diversify its tea products by producing more CTC tea, the main component of tea bags.     Production of black and green teas is forecast in the embassy report to rise to 125,000 tonnes in calendar 1987 from 123,000 tonnes in 1986.     Exports of these teas are likely to rise to 95,000 tonnes in 1987 from 85,000 in 1986 and around 90,000 in 1985.     The embassy noted the ministry of trade tightened quality controls on tea in October 1986 in an effort to become more competititve in the world market.  REUTER &#3;

Japanese importers bought some 95,000 tonnes of Chinese soybeans late last month for May to September shipment, under the semi-annual trade accords, trade sources said.     The FOB premium rose to 13.50 dlrs per tonne, up 2.50 dlrs from the premium for the November to April shipment, but down from 13.80 for the last May to September shipment.     Flat prices for Chinese beans are based on futures prices in Chicago plus the FOB premium.     Japanese purchases of Chinese soybeans, including spot buying, may have totalled 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes of the 1986 crop for November to April 1987 shipment, down from some 300,000 tonnes the previous year, the sources said.     Domestic demand for edible-use soybeans is expected to remain stable at about 240,000 to 250,000 tonnes a year, the sources said.     In recent years Japanese importers have overbought Chinese edible-use soybeans and sold the surplus to domestic crushers, but low 1986 U.S. Crop prices have discouraged the purchase of Chinese origin beans for crushing, they said.

Sweden's Wallenberg group fought back a bid by the London-based Swedish financier Erik Penser to secure a large stake in Swedish Match &lt;SMBS ST>, one of the companies at the core of their business empire.     A statement issued by the Wallenberg holding companies AB Investor and Forvaltnings AB Providentia said they had taken over an option held by Nobel Industrier Sweden AB to acquire 33 pct of the voting rights in Swedish Match.     Thre Wallenbergs paid Nobel Industrier &lt;NOBL ST>, in which Penser group has a 72 pct stake, about 20 pct over the market price for the Swedish Match option, the statement said.     Swedish Match's B shares open to foreign buyers closed at 424 crowns on Friday. The A shares -- with increased voting rights -- closed at 450 crowns for the restricted and 455 for the free shares.     The statement said the deal increased Investor's stake to 49.4 pct of the voting rights and 14.8 pct of the share capital while Providentia is left holding 34.1 pct of the voting rights and 14.5 pct of the share capital in Swedish Match.     The Wallenbergs' stake in Swedish Match had previously amounted to 52 pct of the voting rights in the company.     The Swedish Match deal will cost the Wallenbergs about 400 mln crowns, share analysts said, making it one of the most expensise moves the group has undertaken in the last four years to defend its far-flung interests from outside predators.     The Wallenbergs originally sold Nobel Industrier, an arms and chemicals group, to Penser in 1984 to pay for buying Volvo &lt;VOLV ST> out of two other key group companies, Atlas Copco &lt;ASTS ST> and Stora Koppabergs &lt;SKPS ST>.     Since then, the Wallenbergs were ousted as the largest shareholders in SKF (SKFR ST> by Skanska AB &lt;SKBS ST> and Frederik Lundberg wrested control of Incentive AB from them.     Lundberg, a Zurich-based Swedish property tycoon, also managed to acquire a 25 pct stake in another Wallenberg company, the diary equipment firm Alfa -Laval AB &lt;ALFS ST>.     During 1986, the Wallenbergs have been concentrating on building up their stake in Investor and Providentia to prevent any raid on the heart of their business empire.     But analysts say the Wallenbergs' position in the electrical engineering firm ASEA AB &lt;ASEA ST> is also too small at 12.6 pct of the voting rights and there has been growing speculation that the group will be forced to sell off fringe interests to protect its core activities.

oilseed,soybean,meal-feed,soy-meal	INDONESIAN SOYBEAN IMPORTS FORECAST TO RISE .  Soybean imports are forecast to rise to 425,000 tonnes in 1987/88 (October/September) from an estimated 300,000 in 1986/87 and 375,000 in 1985/86, the U.S. Embassy said in its annual report on Indonesia's agriculture.     It said Indonesia did not achieve its goal of self-sufficiency in soybean output in calendar 1986 because it did not meet a planned increase in area planted and because yields have remained below target.     Soybean meal imports are forecast to fall to around 190,000 tonnes in 1987/88 from 270,000 tonnes in 1986/87 and 295,000 tonnes in 1985/86.     Domestic soybean production is forecast to rise steadily to 1.08 mln tonnes in 1987/88 from 980,000 in the current year and 890,000 in 1985/86, the report said.     Imports are forecast to fall in the current year but to rise in 1987/88 because of a new soybean crushing plant due to come on stream in early 1988.     China is the main supplier with a 79 pct share, while the U.S. Provides the rest, it said.     "This pattern will likely continue during 1986/87 since domestic soyfood processors prefer Chinese beans and are willing to pay a premium for them," it said.     Area planted is expected to increase by 10 pct in both 1986/87 and 1987/88.     "Yield increases continue to be hampered by an insufficient supply of quality seeds, along with pest and disease problems," the report said.  REUTER &#3;

Thousands of black mineworkers roared support for a union proposal to seize control of South Africa's gold, uranium, platinum and coal mines if the owners refuse to improve conditions for migrant black workers.     About 15,000 miners attended a rally here to endorse moves proposed by last week's annual meeting of the 200,000 strong National Union of Mineworkers (NUM).

tin	ATPC MEMBERS FIND WAYS TO CURB TIN EXPORTS .  Mine and industry officials from most member states of the Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) say they have found ways to limit group exports to 96,000 tonnes in the year started March 1, according to views polled by Reuter correspondents.     The plan to curb exports, agreed in January, is aimed at cutting the world surplus to 50,000 tonnes from 70,000 now and boosting prices to about 19 ringgit a kilo from just over 16.     Members of the seven-member Kuala Lumpur-based ATPC account for some 65 pct of the world's tin output.     Under the ATPC plan, Malaysia has been allocated an export quota of 28,526 tonnes, Indonesia 24,516, Thailand 19,000, Bolivia 13,761, Zaire 1,736 and Nigeria 1,461.     Australia has said it is not setting any export quota. However, the tonnage allocated to it, 7,000 tonnes, is roughly equal to its expected output this year.     Comment from officials in Zaire was unavailable.     Mine officials in Malaysia, the world's leading producer, said only 188 mines will be allowed to operate to ensure that output is limited to around 31,500 tonnes in the year started March 1.     Chief Inspector of Mines Redzuan Sumun told Reuters that excess output of some 3,000 tonnes after exports of 28,500 in the one-year quota period would be kept in the national stock.     Mine owners in Malaysia have welcomed the ATPC export curb and asked the government not to issue new mining licences. More than 100 applications for licences are pending.     Redzuan said the Mines Department would approve new mining licences only if a six-month review of production trends showed that local mines were not overproducing.     ATPC chairman and Indonesia's Mining and Energy Minister Subroto has pledged his country's support for the export curb.     A spokesman for the state-owned tin mining company PT Tambang Timah told Reuters it would be easy for Indonesia to stick to an export quota of 24,516 tonnes because this was close to exports in calendar 1986 of 24,636.     In Bangkok, Thai Industry Minister Pramual Sabhavasu said Thailand would keep to its 19,000 tonne quota and added this would not cause the local industry hardship at current prices.     To insure adherence, the industry ministry and sole tin exporter Thailand Smelting and Refining Co would encourage bigger stockpiles, and income tax exemptions would be permitted, he said.     The Thai Mineral Resources Department is expected to disallow new tin mines opening this year to prevent excessive production, industry sources said.     But Mining Industry Council President Dam Teutong told Reuters that if the tin price rose above 18 ringgit a kilo, Thai miners would press for the opening of more new mines.     Thailand exported 18,367 tonnes in 1986, up from 17,359 in 1985, Pramual said.     Bolivia said it expects to export less tin this year than its allocated 13,761 tonne quota.     Mining Minister Jaimie Villalobos told Reuters in La Paz that Bolivia expected to export about 9,000 tonnes of tin in calendar 1987.     He said this was due to the sacking after the tin crisis of October 1985 of about 20,000 of the 28,000 workers at the state mining company Comibol, which produces more than 80 pct of Bolivia's total exports.     He said there were risks in the ATPC plan to cut exports but added he was confident the goals set by the plan would be achieved. He did not elaborate.     Mines, Power and Steel Minister Bunu Sheriff Musa said in Lagos that Nigeria would have no difficulty keeping within its ATPC quota of 1,461 tonnes because its metals output had declined due to poor demand and high production costs.     Industry sources told Reuters that Nigeria's output was less than 1,000 tonnes last year.     ATPC officials said they would monitor member countries' export figures every three months using customs documents and make projections from such data to see if quotas were likely to be breached within the year-long quota period.     The ATPC officials said members that appeared likely to breach their quotas would be told to take remedial measures.     They added that if member countries were unable to fulfil their quotas their extra tonnage would be reallocated to other members at the ATPC's discretion.     The ATPC would have produced and exported an estimated 106,000 tonnes of tin in 1987 without the plan.     Non-members Brazil and China have pledged to cooperate with the ATPC and limit their exports to 21,000 and 7,000 tonnes respectively during the quota period.  REUTER &#3;

Rationalisation measures taken by manufacturing industries to cope with the yen's sharp rise are beginning to brighten their business outlook, the institute said.     It said lower interest rates, which are expected to reduce corporate borrowing costs, are also behind the improved performance outlook.     Earnings performance in the non-manufacturing sector will be supported by firm demand in the real estate and construction businesses, it said.

The Bank of Japan decided at a policy board meeting to promote further interest rate liberalisation by lowering the minimum denomination of regulation-free large deposits and by raising the interest rate ceiling on money market certificates (MMCs), a central bank official said.     The new guideline will go into effect on April 6, the bank said.     Under the guideline, the minimum denomination of regulation-free large deposits will be lowered to 100 mln yen from 300 mln.     The interest rate ceiling of MMCs with maturities of between one year and two years will be set at 0.5 percentage point below the prevailing certificate of deposit rate, the bank said.     But the ceiling on MMCs with maturities of one year or less will remain the same, or 0.75 percentage point below the CD rates.     The minimum denomination of MMCs will be lowered to 10 mln yen from 30 mln.     The bank also said time deposit rates will be lowered by 0.37 point, effective March 16, in line with the half-point cut in the official discount rate on February 23.     New interest rates on two-year and one-year deposits at banks, for example, will be 3.64 pct and 3.39 pct per annum, respectively.     Demand deposit rates, however, will remain the same.

State-owned (Taiwan Power co) will boost its domestic borrowings to further cut its foreign debt in line with a government policy to trim the island's huge foreign exchange reserves, a company official said.     The company's foreign debt, mainly from the Japanese and U.S. Banks, was cut nearly by half to 66.2 billion taiwan dlrs equivalent in calendar 1986 from 124.6 billion in 1985, he said.

money-supply	U.K. CONFIRMS JANUARY STERLING M3 RISE .  The Bank of England said the broad measure of U.K. Money supply, Sterling M3, rose a seasonally adjusted 1.1 pct in January after a 0.2 pct rise in December.     The unadjusted year-on-year rise was 17.6 pct after 18.1 pct in the year to December.     The narrow measure of money supply, M0, fell by a seasonally adjusted 0.6 pct in January, and rose by a non-adjusted 4.1 pct year-on-year, the Bank said.     The figures confirm provisional data issued by the Bank two weks ago.     In December, M0 grew by a seasonally adjusted 1.4 pct and by a non-seasonally adjusted 5.2 pct year-on-year.     The Bank said sterling bank lending grew by a non-seasonally adjusted 1.75 billion stg in January. This also confirmed provisional figures issued in February.     The measure of private sector liquidity, PSL2, fell 0.2 pct in January, but after seasonal adjustment rose 0.6 pct, the Bank said.     The Bank said the public sector contribution to the growth in Sterling M3 was contractionary by about 2.3 billion stg.     Within this, the Public Sector Borrowing Requirement (PSBR) showed a repayment of 3.7 billion stg, while the non-bank private sector's holdings of government debt fell by about 1.1 billion stg.     There was a fall of 290 mln stg in notes and coin in January, a fall of 1.5 billion stg in non-interest bearing sight deposits, and a rise of 1.6 billion stg in interest bearing sight deposits, the Bank said.

Exco Chairman Richard Lacy told Reuters the acquisition was being made from Bank of New York Co Inc &lt;BK.N>, which currently holds a 50.1 pct, and from RMJ partners who hold the remainder.     Bank of New York and the partners will retain about 10 pct each and these stakes will be bought over the next six years.     RMJ is the holding company of RMJ Securities, one of the largest U.S. Government securities brokers.     It is also involved in broking notes, obligations and other instruments sponsored by U.S. Federal agencies.     Lacy said Exco had been considering buying a U.S. Government securities broker for the past four years and had made an offer for RMJ when it was sold by Security Pacific Corp &lt;SPC.N> in 1985. RMJ was then valued at about 50 mln dlrs.     B and C managing director Peter Goldie said RMJ would be bought at about the same multiple as Exco, suggesting net income of around 16 mln dlrs.     The company's earnings had not been hit by the halving of brokerage fees some 14 months ago as volumes had since doubled.     Lacy said that RMJ employed some 300 people, with 200 in the brokerage business and about 70 in its &lt;SMS> unit, which provided computer software for the financial services community.     RMJ Securities had offices in New York, where total market turnover of U.S. Government securities was 110 billion dlrs a day, and in London where it has 15 billion.     It was also given permission last week to open an office in Tokyo where total market turnover had lifted rapidly to about five billion dlrs a day.     The acquisition would contribute between five and 10 pct of B and C's share earnings in 1987 on a proforma basis.  REUTER &#3;

trade	JAPAN, U.S. SET TO BEGIN HIGH-LEVEL TRADE TALKS .  Japan and the U.S. Kick off top-level trade talks tomorrow amid signs officials from both sides are growing increasingly irritated with each other.     The talks, held annually at sub-cabinet level to review the whole gamut of U.S./Japan economic relations, will pave the way for American Secretary of State George Schultz's one day stop-over here at end-week on his way home from China.     Faced with growing Congressional protectionist pressure, the U.S. Administration is pressing Japan for speedy action to reduce its still huge trade surplus, U.S. Officials said.     "We appreciate their frustration," a senior Japanese government official said. "But we are also frustrated."     The official said the 40 pct rise of the yen over the last 18 months has hit Japan hard, forcing exporters to slash spending and lay off workers to make up for lost sales abroad. That has not yet shown up in dollar-based statistics on trade, but it will, he said.     He said the U.S. Administration was ignoring the progress that has been made and instead emphasizing the problems that remain when it talks with Congress.     "It would only take five minutes to list their accomplishments," a senior U.S. Official replied.     The talks begin tomorrow with high-level discussions on the economic structures of both countries and how they affect the bilateral trade imbalance, which last year amounted to 51.48 billion dlrs in Japan's favour.     On the following two days, the topics will range from multilateral trade talks under the auspices of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT) to such bilateral trade problems as super computers.     The structural talks are intended to be free-wheeling discussions among senior officials. Tomorrow's topics include savings and investment issues such as consumer credit and housing, and the implications of government budget deficits.     These talks come at a particularly delicate time for the Japanese government, which is facing increasing domestic pressure to abandon its tight-fisted fiscal policy and stimulate the sagging economy by spending more.     Some U.S. Officials complained Japan has no intention of boosting domestic demand and imports, as Washington wants.     Japanese officials in turn pointed the finger at the huge U.S. Budget deficit as one of the main culprits for the trade imbalance. That budget deficit has meant that the U.S. Is buying more imports.     Japan seems particularly peeved at being singled in a draft trade bill before the Senate as a nation following adverserial trade practices. "It condemns Japan without due process," one Japanese official said.     That reference spoils what is otherwise a well-thought-out bill introduced by Democratic Senator Lloyd Bentsen, he said.     Japan is also not totally happy with the administration's trade bill, particularly its proposal to establish reciprocal access to foreign markets as one criteria for retaliatory trade action by the U.S., Officials said.     Nevertheless, Japanese officials said they remain in a weak bargaining position, especially with the threat of a trade bill overhanging them.     "We have no leverage," one official admitted.     As a result, Tokyo is striving to meet U.S. Complaints about its trade practices in a variety of fields, including super computers.     The U.S. Is pressing for greater access to the Japanese super computer market.     The Japanese government has sent a long questionnaire to public institutions like universities which buy the sophisticated machines in hopes of eventually setting up informal bidding procedures easily understood by all potential sellers, officials said.

The European Community Commission said it has opened an enquiry into allegations that the Soviet Union is dumping mercury on the European market at below-cost prices.     The Commission said its decision follows a complaint from EC non-ferrous metals producers that the sales of Soviet mercury were harming their business and threatening jobs in the European industry.     According to the complaint, Soviet mercury sales in the EC had risen from zero in recent years to 100 tonnes between August and October last year and threaten to capture 25 pct of the EC market if they continue at the same pace.     The industry said the mercury was being sold at more than 40 pct below prices charged by EC producers, forcing them to cut their prices to levels that no longer covered costs. The imports had caused producers heavy financial losses, it said.     The Commission said the industry would probably be unable to hold prices at current levels and that any increase would result in loss of sales and jobs.     The so-called anti-dumping procedure opened by the Commission will allow all interested parties to state their cases to the authority.  REUTER &#3;

trade	TAIWAN PLANS NEW TARIFF CUTS .  Taiwan plans another round of deep tariff cuts this year to help narrow its trade surplus with the U.S., A senior economic planner said.     Wang Chao-Ming, vice-chairman of the council for economic planning and development, told Reuters Taiwan would further reduce import tariffs on 1,700 products sometime in the second half of this year.     Cuts of up to 50 pct on those items were made last year and Wang said further cuts would go much deeper.     "We have to speed up liberalisation and cut import tariffs faster and more substantially," he said.     The United States, Taiwan's main trading partner, has said the island's import tariffs, still ranging from a high of almost 60 pct, were unacceptable. It has criticised the cuts as too selective.      Taiwan's trade surplus with the United States hit 13.6 billion dlrs last year. The surplus has boosted foreign exchange reserves to 50 billion dlrs, which Wang said made Taiwan a target for U.S. Protectionism.     Wang said the trade surplus and the reserves weakened Taiwan's position in talks with Washington over export quotas, particularly for shoes, textiles and machine tools which are among the island's main export-earners.     A special Taiwanese trade delegation leaves for Washington tomorrow to try to renegotiate an agreement signed last year limiting exports of Taiwan textiles.     Under the accord, Taiwan's textile export growth was limited to 0.5 pct each year until 1988. Taipei has said it is losing markets to South Korea and Hong Kong which were given more generous terms.

earn	HUTCHISON SEES HIGHER PAYOUT, SATISFACTORY PROFITS .  Hutchison Whampoa Ltd &lt;HWHH.HK> expects satisfactory profits in 1987 and will pay a higher dividend for the year, chairman Li Ka-shing said.     He did not make any specific projections for the company's earnings this year but he said the firm will pay a dividend of not less than 32.5 cents per share after a proposed four-for-one stock split and a one-for-four bonus issue.     It paid total dividends of 1.30 dlrs per share last year, equal to 26 cents per share, adjusting for the bonus and share split.     Hutchison, which has operations ranging from trading to property and container terminals, earlier reported after-tax profits of 1.62 billion dlrs against 1.19 billion dlrs in 1985.     The 1986 total excluded extraordinary gains of 563 mln dlrs, partly from the sale of some of its stake in the South China Morning Post, the leading English language newspaper, compared with 369 mln dlrs the previous year. It said it expects another 277 mln dlr gain in 1987 from the sale of the remaining shares.     Li said Hong Kong's property market remains strong while its economy is performing better than forecast with its largely export-led growth.     Gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct last year against an initial government projection of 4.5 pct.     But he said Hong Kong's large trade deficit with the U.S. May result in protectionist measures that will adversely affect the British colony.     He said all of the company's major operations showed improved results in 1986.     Hutchison said earlier it will sell its entire 23.5 pct interest in Hongkong Electric Holdings Ltd &lt;HKEH.HK> to &lt;Cavendish International Holdings Ltd>, itself a spin-off from Hongkong Electric.     Under a reorganisation announced separately, Hongkong Electric will spin off all its non-electricity related activities into Cavendish, which will be listed on the local stock exchange. Hongkong Electric shareholders will receive one share in Cavendish for every Hongkong Electric share.     Cavendish will buy the 348.2 mln Hongkong Electric shares from Hutchison by issuing 975 mln new shares.     The spin-off and the sale of Hongkong Electric shares will give Hutchison a 53 pct stake in Cavendish.     Li said the decision to spin-off Cavendish is to relieve Hongkong Electric of public criticism of the power company for making risky investments. But he denied there was pressure from the government for the spin-off.     He said Cavendish will have seven billion dlrs of assets and will be almost debt free, with 340 mln dlrs of liabilites.

acq	AMERICAN EXPRESS &lt;AXP> VIEWING SHEARSON OPTIONS .  American Express Co, rumored to be considering a spinoff of part of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc, said it is studying a range of options for its brokerage unit that could improve Shearon's access to capital and help it meet broadening international competition.     In a joint statement, American Express and Shearson said the actions under consideration are an integral part of American Express' worldwide financial services strategy and that the two companies have been having both internal and external discussions on the matters.     American Express said no decision has been reached on the strategic options and that it and Shearson could ultimately decide to follow growth plans already in place.     Last week, rumors circulated on Wall Street that the financial services giant was considering a spinoff of part of Shearson and there was speculation it may be considering selling a stake to a Japanese firm. Analysts said the speculation also focused on American Express selling 20 pct of the profitable brokerage firm to the public.     There was some speculation that American Express had also considered a total spinoff of Shearson, but the plan was considered highly unlikely, analysts said.      American Express said in the statement on Sunday that it will not comment on rumors and speculation and a spokesman would not go beyond the statement. The company also remained silent last Thursday and Friday, as rumors drove American Express stock up a total of 5-1/2 dlrs in two days to bring it to a Friday close at 74.      It said it issued the statement on Sunday because a similar statement was being circulated to employees.     Analysts have been divided on whether it makes sense for American Express to give up a stake in the wholly-owned brokerage, which improved its after-tax earnings by about 50 pct in the last year.     Some analysts said American Express may consider spinning off part of Shearson because it is concerned that its stock price does not fully reflect the value of the brokerage firm.      Shearson contributed 316 mln dlrs of American Express' 1.25 billion dlr net in 1986.     American Express' ambitious plans for international growth may be also enhanced by the added cash that spinning out part of Shearson would bring. Analysts speculated that all of Shearson would have a market value of about 3.5 billion dlrs.     To some however, the need for added capital is puzzling. "(American) Express is in a position where they can raise capital if they need to," said Larry Eckenfelder of Prudential-Bache Securities.     Analysts said rumors were fed by the reorganization of Shearson management Wednesday. Chief operating officer Jeffrey Lane got the added, previously vacant, post of president.      The reorganization also created four new positions for chairmen of Shearson's operating divisions, a move analysts speculated would allow Shearson to be a stand alone company.      Analysts, contacted on Sunday said the statement does little to clarify last week's market speculation. It does confirm, however, that the financial services firm, which unsuccessfully attempted to expand Shearson with a major acquisition last year, is looking beyond its own walls for growth and positioning in the global market competition.     Late last year, Shearson's takeover offer to the E.F. Hutton Group Inc was rejected by Hutton, and analysts said there had been speculation that Shearson also was rebuffed when it approached another major Wall Street brokerage.          Reuter &#3;

acq	PUROLATOR &lt;PCC> IN BUYOUT WITH HUTTON &lt;EFH> .  New Jersey-based overnight messenger Purolator Courier Corp said it has agreed to be acquired for about 265 mln dlrs by a company formed by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and certain managers of Purolator's U.S. courier business.     Analysts have said that Purolator has been for sale for some time. Purolator announced earlier it was mulling a takeover bid, but analysts wrongly predicted the offer was from another courier company.     Hutton LBO, a wholly owned subsidiary of E.F. Hutton Group Inc, will be majority owner of the company.     Hutton said the acquiring company, PC Acquisition Inc, is paying 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of Purolator's stock in a tender offer to begin Thursday. The rest of the shares will be purchased for securities and warrants to buy stock in a subsidiary of PC Acquisition, containing Purolator's U.S. courier operations.     If all the shares of Purolator are tendered, shareholders would receive for each share 29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in debentures, and a warrant to buy shares in a subsidiary of PC Acquisition containing the U.S. courier operations.     Hutton said in the merger shareholders would get 46 mln dlrs aggregate amount of guaranteed debentures due 2002 of PC Acquisition and warrants to buy 15 pct of the common stock of the PC courier subsidiary. Hutton said the company has valued the warrants at two to three dlrs per share.     Purolator's stock price closed at 35.125 dlrs on Friday. While some analysts estimated the company was worth in the mid 30s, at least one said it would be worth 38 to 42 dlrs.     This follows sales of two other Purolator units. It agreed recently to sell its Canadian Courier unit to Onex Capital for 170 mln dlrs, and previously sold its auto filters business.     Purolator retains its Stant division, which makes closure caps for radiators and gas tanks. A Hutton spokesman said the firm is reviewing its options on Stant.     Purolator's courier business has been lagging that of its U.S. rivals because of the high price it paid in the past several years to add air delivery to its ground fleet.     E.F. Hutton will provide 279 mln dlrs of its funds to complete the transaction. This so-called "bridge" financing will be replaced later with long-term debt most likely in the form of bank loans, Hutton said. Hutton LBO is committed to keeping the courier business, its president Warren Idsal said.     "Purolator lost 120 mln dlrs over the last two years largely due to U.S. courier operations, which we believe the management is turning around. We belive it will be a very serious competitor in the future," said Idsal.     William Taggart, chief executive officer of U.S. Courier division, will be chief executive officer of the new company.     The tender offer will be conditioned on a minimum of two thirds of the common stock being tendered and not withdrawn to the expiration of the offer as well as certain other conditions.     The offer will begin Thursday, subject to clearances from the staff of the Interstate Commerce Commission and will expire 20 business days after commencement unless extended.  Reuter &#3;
cotton	PAKISTAN COTTON OUTPUT REACHES 7.7 MLN BALES .  Pakistan cotton production during the current crop season (Sept/March) reached 7.7 mln bales of 375 pounds each, up 500,000 from last season, Shafi Niaz, Chairman of the Agricultural Prices Commission, said.

Cheung Kong (Holdings) Ltd &lt;CKGH.HK> is expecting strong results this year after reporting better than expected profits in 1986, chairman Li Ka-shing said.     He did not give a specific earnings projection but he told reporters the firm will pay total dividends of not less than 19 cents a share this year after a one-for-four bonus issue and a four-for-one stock split.     The company earlier declared total dividends equal to 15 cents a share for 1986, adjusting for the stock split and bonus issue.     Cheung Kong's earnings rose to 1.28 billion H.K. Dlrs in 1986, well above market expectations of 920 mln to one billion dlrs. They compared with profits of 551.7 mln dlrs in 1985.

It had gains of 81.3 mln dlrs in 1985.     Li attributed the surge in 1986 earnings to a buoyant local property market and substantial increases in contributions from associated companies.     "Looking ahead, 1987 should be another year of stability for the property market," Li said. "The growth in (Hong Kong's) exports is expected to stimulate the demand for industrial buildings."

Investor Sumner Redstone, who leads one of the two groups vying for control of Viacom International Inc, offered to sweeten his bid for the company by 1.50 dlrs a share cash and 1.50 dlrs in securities.     In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Redstone, who controls Dedham, Mass.,-based National Amusements Inc, a theater chain operator, offered to raise the cash portion of its Viacom offer to 42 dlrs a share from 40.50 dlrs.     Redstone also raised the face value of the preferred stock he is offering to 7.50 dlrs from six dlrs.     The Redstone offer, which is being made through Arsenal Holdings Inc, a National Amusements subsidiary set up for that purpose, which also give Viacom shareholders one-fifth of a share of Arsenal common stock after the takeover.     Viacom said earlier today it received revised takeover bids from Redstone and MCV Holdings Inc, a group led by Viacom management which is competing with Redstone for control of the company and already has a formal merger agreement with Viacom.     The company did not disclose the details of the revised offers, but said a special committee of its board would review them later today.     The Redstone group, which has a 19.5 pct stake in Viacom, and the management group, which has a 5.4 pct stake, have both agreed not to buy more shares of the company until a merger is completed, unless the purchases are part of a tender offer for at least half of the outstanding stock.     The two rivals also signed confidentiality agreements, which give them access to Viacom's financial records provided they keep the information secret.     In his SEC filing, Redstone, who estimated his cost of completing the takeover at 2.95 billion dlrs, said Bank of America is confident it can raise 2.275 billion dlrs.     Besides the financing it would raise through a bank syndicate, Bank of America has also agreed to provide a separate 25 mln dlr for the limited purpose of partial financing and has committed to provide another 592 mln dlrs, Redstone said.     Merrill Lynch, Pierce Fenner and Smith Inc has increased its underwriting commitment to 175 mln dlrs of subordinated financing debt for the Viacom takeover, from the 150 mln dlrs it agreed to underwrite earlier, Redstone said.     Redstone said his group would contribute more than 475 mln dlrs in equity toward the takeover.     The Redstone equity contribution to the takeover would consist of all of his group's 6,881,800 Viacom common shares and at least 118 mln dlrs cash, he said.     The new offer, the second sweetened deal Redstone has proposed in his month-long bidding war with management, also contains newly drawn up proposed merger documents, he said.     Last week, the management group submitted what it called its last offer for the company, valued at 3.1 mln dlrs and consisting of 38.50 dlrs a share cash, preferred stock valued at eight dlrs a share and equity in the new company. Redstone's previous offer had been valued at 3.2 billion dlrs.  Reuter &#3;

The latest requests for the maize were for export to Switzerland, Austria and Lichtenstein at a maximum daily rebate prefixed last Friday at 141 Ecus a tonne against a previous 20 Ecu daily rebate.     The special daily rebate for maize was set in the context of a Commission commitment to grant this season rebates for the export of 500,000 tonnes of French maize to non-EC countries, in compensation for concessions to the U.S. in the recent dispute over grain sales to Spain.     If the latest French requests are accepted as expected, this will bring the total of French maize exported in this context to 25,500 tonnes.     The Commission last Thursday granted weekly rebates for the sale of 15,000 tonnes of free market maize to non-EC countries.     Requests for barley were for export to Switzerland, Austria and Lichtenstein, Ceuta and Melilla at an unchanged pre-fixed restitution of 125 Ecus a tonne, while requests for soft wheat flour were for export to various non-EC countries at an unchanged 178 Ecus a tonne.

Describing this as a major departure in the company's approach to commercial development, he told the annual new business forum of the Commercial Development Association "We are looking to acquisitions and joint ventures when they look like the fastest and most promising routes to the growth markets we've identified."     Not very long ago Union Carbide had the attitude "that if we couldn't do it ourselves, it wasn't worth doing. Or, if it was worth doing, we had to go it alone," Lichtenberger explained.     He said "there are times when exploiting a profitable market is done best with a partner. Nor do we see any need to plow resources into a technology we may not have if we can link up profitably with someone who is already there."     He said Carbide has extended its catalyst business that way and is now extending its specialty chemicals business in the same way.  Reuter &#3;

The Canadian government is expected to announce later this week its final ruling whether U.S. corn exports to Canada have injured Ontario corn growers, U.S. government and farm group representatives said.     The deadline for a final determination is March 7.     U.S. officials said they are encouraged by the outcome in a similar case covering European pasta imports. In that case, Canada decided pasta imports, which take about ten pct of the Canadian market, did not injure domestic producers. U.S. corn exports represent only about five pct of the Canadian market.     Canada slapped a 1.05 dlrs per bushel duty on U.S. corn imports in November 1986, but reduced the duty to 85 cts last month because the Canadian government said U.S. subsidies to  corn producers were less than Canada earlier estimated.

iron-steel	EC COMMISSION GIVEN PLAN TO SAVE STEEL INDUSTRY .  European Community steelmakers presented the Executive Commission with a controversial plan for the future of the industry which diplomats say it may be forced reluctantly to accept.     Under the plan steel output would remain subject to restrictive quotas and imports would be firmly controlled for years to come while steel firms undertook a massive slimming-down operation to adjust capacity to lower demand.     Industry Commissioner Karl-Heinz Narjes has proposed the ending of the quota system by December 1988.     He has proposed a return to the free market, which under EC law is supposed to exist except in times of "manifest crisis."     But diplomats said some ministers who meet to discuss this idea on March 19 will argue that steel firms are in crisis in their countries, with orders falling as customers switch to alternative products and accounts firmly in the red.     Ministers from the EC's major steel producing countries are likely to shy away from Narjes' proposals and could back the industry's own plan instead, in the hope of minimising the political impact of plant closures, they said.     Industry sources said the plan presented to Narjes by the EC steelmakers' lobby group Eurofer would retain the quota production system at least until the end of 1990.     Eurofer said in a statement consultants working for it identified scope for closing plants on a "voluntary" basis to reduce capacity by 15.26 mln tonnes a year.     Cuts were still insufficient in one production area, that of hot rolled coils, and further talks were needed.     Eurofer added the industry would need the support of the Commission and governments in carrying out a closure program, particularly with social costs such as redundancy payments.     The EC steel industry has already shed 240,000 jobs this decade while reducing annual capacity by 31 mln tonnes.  Reuter &#3;

Unocal Corp's Union Oil Co said it lowered its posted prices for crude oil one to 1.50 dlrs a barrel in the eastern region of the U.S., effective Feb 26.     Union said a 1.50 dlrs cut brings its posted price for the U.S. benchmark grade, West Texas Intermediate, to 16 dlrs. Louisiana Sweet also was lowered 1.50 dlrs to 16.35 dlrs, the company said.

Panhandle Eastern Corp's Trunkline Gas Co pipeline subsidiary said it is reducing the commodity component of its wholesale natural gas rate four pct, effective immediately.

The company said the lower rate results from a reduction in the average price the pipeline is paying for gas, adding this reflects contract reformation agreemats with producers.  Reuter &#3;
acq	INVESTOR GROUP HAS TALKS WITH PESCH ON AMI &lt;AMI> .  WEDGE Group Inc, a Houston investment firm with a 5.5 pct stake in American Medical International Inc, said it has had talks with Pesch and Co, which is seeking control of the company.     In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, WEDGE, which is owned by Issam Fares, a Lebanese citizen living in Switzerland, also said it discussed the possibility of joining with others in its own bid to seek control of AMI.     WEDGE stressed that it has no current plans to seek control of AMI, but refused to rule out a takeover try in the future.     WEDGE said it has had discussions with AMI management, Pesch, the closely held health care and investment concern controlled by Chicago physician LeRoy Pesch, and other AMI shareholders.     It did not specify in its SEC filing which issues -- selling its AMI stake or joining with others in a takeover try -- were discussed with which group. But it said the talks did not produce any agreements or understandings.     WEDGE said it believes that "some form of restructuring of AMI and its business would be highly desirable and appropriate at this time."     WEDGE, which holds 4.8 mln shares of AMI common stock, said it plans to hold further talks with company management, Pesch and other shareholders.     Pesch last week sweetened his bid for the company to 22 dlrs a share in cash and securties, or 1.91 billion dlrs based on AMI's total outstanding, from an all-cash 20 dlr a share bid, which the company rejected.

Talks at the extended special meeting of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) on the reintroduction of export quotas continued, but chances of success were still almost impossible to gauge, delegates said.     Producer delegates were meeting to examine a Colombian proposal to resume historical quotas from April 1 to September, with a promise to define specific new criteria by which a new quota system would be calculated in September for the new crop year, they said.     Opinions among delegates over the potential for reaching a quota agreement varied widely.     Some consumers said the mood of the meeting seemed slightly more optimistic. But Brazil's unwillingness to concede any of its traditional 30.55 pct of its export market share looks likely to preclude any accord, other delegates said.     No fresh proposals other than the Colombian initiative had been tabled formally today, delegates said.     A full council meeting was set for 1900 hours for a progress report, delegates said.

In a Vancouver address, Crosbie said Versatile Pacific Shipyards Inc was the low bidder to build the Arctic Class 8 icebreaker, but the company must meet certain financial and engineering conditions before the contract is awarded.     The government also announced it will provide up to 13 mln dlrs in loan insurance to help Versatile prepare for the construction of the vessel. said before the contract can be awarded Versatile "will be required to offer assurances that the shipyard is technically and financially capable of performing the work."     Crosibie said Versatile's bid was 100 mln dlrs lower than competing bidders and will generate 1,000 person years of direct employment.     Work on the vessel, which Crosbie said would be the most powerful icebreaker in the world, would begin next year and completed in 1992.     The government announced plans to build the icebreaker last year following the controversial passage of the U.S. Coast Guard's vessel, the Polar Sea, through the disputed Northwest Passage. The U.S. government did not seek permission for the journey, claiming the area was an international water way.     The government said the icebreaker was needed to back up the country's claim of sovereignty in the Arctic.  Reuter &#3;

sugar	CUBA TELLS TRADERS SUGAR EXPORTS MAY BE DELAYED .  Cuba has told international sugar operators who have bought its sugar for shipment in March that these contracts will take second place to Cuba's direct shipments to its export markets, dealers here said.     Some traders who have received telexes from Cuba said the language of the message was not totally clear and some believed shipments would be honoured if the traders declare the Soviet Union as the destination of their contracts.     The telexes have fueled rising world prices in the last week and reflect a poor Cuban crop, worry over Brazil's export availability, and increasing Soviet demand, analysts said.     Traders said signs of Cuba's shortage of immediately available raw sugar to supply its traditional martkets was probably the factor behind Syria calling a snap buying tender last month.     Normally Syria calls white sugar buying tenders for forward delivery, and last month's spot requirement resulted in the sale of several cargoes.     Cuba in its telex told operators they would not receive March shipments as Cuba has to meet its contracts to export markets, traders said.  Reuter &#3;

The agreement by the seven-member Association of Tin Producing Countries (ATPC) aimed to cut the world surplus and boost prices. Following the accord, ATPC Chairman Subroto appealed to the United States to restrict its tin releases from its strategic stockpile.

crude	NYMEX WILL EXPAND OFF-HOUR TRADING APRIL ONE .  The New York Mercantile Exchange set April one for the debut of a new procedure in the energy complex that will increase the use of energy futures worldwide.      On April one, NYMEX will allow oil traders that do not hold a futures position to initiate, after the exchange closes, a transaction that can subsequently be hedged in the futures market, according to an exchange spokeswoman.     "This will change the way oil is transacted in the real world," said said Thomas McKiernan, McKiernan and Co chairman.     Foreign traders will be able to hedge trades against NYMEX prices before the exchange opens and negotiate prices at a differential to NYMEX prices, McKiernan explained.      The expanded program "will serve the industry because the oil market does not close when NYMEX does," said Frank Capozza, secretary of Century Resources Inc.      The rule change, which has already taken effect for platinum futures on NYMEX, is expected to increase the open interest and liquidity in U.S. energy futures, according to traders and analysts.     Currently, at least one trader in this transaction, called an exchange for physical or EFP, must hold a futures position before entering into the transaction.     Under the new arrangement, neither party has to hold a futures position before entering into an EFP and one or both parties can offset their cash transaction with a futures contract the next day, according to exchange officials.     When NYMEX announced its proposed rule change in December, NYMEX President Rosemary McFadden, said, "Expansion of the EFP provision will add to globalization of the energy markets by providing for, in effect, 24-hour trading."     The Commodity Futures Trading Commission approved the rule change in February, according to a CFTC spokeswoman.  Reuter &#3;

acq	TALKING POINT/VIACOM INTERNATIONAL &lt;VIA> .  A bidding war for Viacom International Inc, one of the largest U.S. entertainment companies, pitted a management group and other investors against National Amusements Inc, a closely held theater operator.     Both sides raised their bids over the weekend. A source close to the management side insisted that timing was on his side. He said if outside directors approve the management proposal, a merger plan could be put to a vote of shareholders with proxy material going out late this week. "It would take 20 days from the day we mail," said the source.     The source predicted National Amusements, controlled by investor Sumner Redstone, would need "half a year" to complete a tender offer because of the regulatory approvals that must accompany any change in control of Viacom's broadcast licenses and cable television franchises.     Redstone was not available for comment.     Some of Wall Street's arbitrage players said it was a rare situation that could only be enjoyed - a true bidding war. One said Redstone could begin a tender offer whenever he wanted and if enough people were convinced his proposal was superior to the Viacom management plan, he would have a chance to win.     The independent directors of Viacom were called into a meeting today. Word on a decision was expected early tomorrow.     Viacom shares climbed 2-1/2 to 50-3/8 by midafternoon. One major Wall Street firm issued a sell recommendation. "We think we're at the end now, in terms of bidding," said the firm's arbitrageur, who spoke on condition he not be identified.     Both Redstone's proposal and the management proposal would create a restructured company heavily leveraged with debt. The management plan would result in a balance sheet with about 2.5 billion dlrs in debt and nearly 500 mln dlrs in preferred stock, convertible into 45 pct of the common stock.     Redstone's newest proposal offers holders 42 dlrs in cash, a fraction of a share of exchangeable preferred stock with a value of 7.50 dlrs, and one-fifth of a share of common stock stock of Arsenal Holdings, representing 20 pct of the equity interest in the restructured Viacom. One arbitrageur calculated the equity in the Redstone plan was worth 2.50 dlrs making the total package worth 52 dlrs per share.     Management offered 38.50 dlrs in cash, exchangeable preferred stock worth 8.50 dlrs and a fractional share of convertible preferred. The arbitrageur said the equity portion was worth about 4.00 dlrs for a total of 51 dlrs.     Redstone's newest plan raised the amount of interest he would pay on the cash portion of his offer for every day beyond April 30 that a merger with Arsenal is not consummated. The plan calls for intest to be paid at an annual rate of nine pct during May and 12 pct thereafter. Previously Redstone offered eight pct interest.     Other arbitrageurs said both Redstone and the management group, led by president and chief executive Terrence Elkes, were offering high prices. "Redstone really wants to own the company," one said. Another said management seemed to have the edge on the timing issue.     Redstone's company owns 19.6 pct ov Viacom's 35 mln shares.     A Wall Street analyst said it was hard to determine what the equity in the newly leveraged company would be worth. He noted as an example that new stock in FMC Corp &lt;FMC>, which adopted a highly leveraged structure last year, inititally traded at 12.50 dlrs per share, dipped to nine dlrs, and is now just over 30 dlrs.     Last week, Viacom reported fourth quarter earnings fell two two cts per share from 23 cts. The company said interest costs from several acquisitions affected results.     Shares of Warner Communications Inc &lt;WCI> rose 7/8 to 31-1/8. Analysts noted Warner owns warrants to purchase 3.25 mln Viacom shares at 35 dlrs and another 1.25 mln shares at 37.50 dlrs.     Chris Craft Industries &lt;CCN>, which owns a stake in Warner, rose 1-1/4 to 22-3/4.     Viacom was created in 1970 and spun off from CBS Inc &lt;CBS>. The company has 940,000 cable television subscribers, operates nine satellite television services and owns television and radio stations.

trade	TALKS SHOW NEW CANADIAN CONFIDENCE, GROUP SAYS .  Canada's decision to raise the issue of a free trade pact with the U.S. was a sign of what many see as a new spirit of Canadian self-confidence, a public policy study group said      "It suggests the Canada of the immediate post-war period, when it was a major player in the process of building a postwar world," the Washington-based Atlantic Council said.     U.S. and Canadian negotiators opened talks last summer aimed at dismantling trade barriers between the two countries, the world's biggest trading partners with crossborder shipments of about 150 billion dlrs annually.     The council's study said the trade talks, with a deadline of October for an agreement, are the biggest issue in U.S.-Canadian relations.    The study said liberalized trade between the two countries would improve the competitiveness of their economies in world markets and lessen trade irritants which now mar their ties.     The council said "in the past most Canadians have shied away from the notion of a free-trade arrangement, fearing to be overwhelmed economically and politically by a closer association with a country 10 times their size in population."     But at the same time, it added, Canadians realized their domestic market was too small to permit the mass production and sales needed to raise productivity to the level demanded by an increasingly competitive world.     The council said that in the talks, Canada is chiefly interested in minimizing the imposing of U.S. duties against  allegedly subsidized exports.     A recent example was the 15 per cent duty the U.S. imposed on Canadian lumber exports on grounds the shipments were being subsidized.     The council said the chief U.S. concerns included ending curbs against U.S. banking, insurance, telecommunications, and the so-called "cultural industries" - publishing, broadcasting and films.     It said other major U.S.-Canadian issues were defense cooperation, "acid rain" and the U.S. rejection of a Canadian assertion of sovereignty over waters of the Northwest Passage.  Reuter &#3;

earn,acq	ICI &lt;ICI> SEEKS GAINS IN SPECIALTY BUSINESSES .  Imperial Chemical Industries PLC, the largest chemical company in the United Kingdom, will expand its specialty chemicals and drug businesses this year, and better its 1986 results, said chairman-elect Denys Henderson.     "We expect to shift our company toward higher value-added businesses and continue to broaden our base," Henderson told reporters at an informal meeting here.     ICI today announced the formation of a new U.S. drug company, ICI Pharma, which, with its Stuart Pharmaceuticals unit, it said will double its current pharmaceutical sales to 1.1 billion dlrs by 1990.     Henderson said, "Our pharmaceutical business gets lost in the way that Glaxo's (Glaxo Holdings PLC) does not."     ICI's pharmaceutical division is the second largest drug maker behind Glaxo in the U.K. Last year U.S. drug sales were about 40 pct of its worldwide drug sales of 1.5 billion dlrs, which in turn brought in 27 pct of its total profits.     He estimated that by 1990, ICI's pharmaceutical division would account for about 30 pct of total company profits.     "The drug division far and away brings in the highest rate of return," said A.W. Clements, finance director of ICI, who was also at the meeting.     Henderson said the new U.S. drug concern would basically act as a second sales force to double the exposure of its drugs to doctors. ICI will hire 145 new salespeople by October one.     Henderson said the major new products in the company's pipeline, expected to each bring in sales of over 200 mln dlrs annually, were Statil, a treatment for diabetic complications, Zoladex, a treatment for advanced prostate cancer, and Carwin, a treatment for mild to moderate congestive heart failure.     Henderson said U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval to market Statil and Zoladex, both under joint licensing agreements with Merck and Co Inc &lt;MRK>, is not expected until about 1989. ICI expects to file for permission to market Carwin in the U.S. later this year.     Henderson said the company's 1987 results would top 1986 income of 888 mln dlrs or 5.45 dlrs per ADR on sales of 15 billion dlrs, but he declined to specify by how much.     Henderson said 1987's results would be boosted by Glidden Paints, which ICI bought last November for 580 mln dlrs from a unit of Hanson Industries Inc.     Henderson also said that ICI has about nine billion dlrs available for acquisitions. Last year the company made 40 acquisitions, the largest being Glidden. He said that more acquisitions may be made this year but he ruled out an acquisition of a pharmaceutical concern as "too expensive."     Henderson said that in his new role of chairman, effective April one when he takes over from Sir John Harvey-Jones who will retire, the biggest challenge ahead lay in continuing the earnings momentum ICI has established over the past few years after restructuring and selling off unprofitable businesses.

grain,wheat	U.S. WHEAT GROUPS CALL FOR GLOBAL ACTION .  All major grain producing countries must do their part to help reduce global surpluses and the recent Australian farm policy proposals are flawed, two U.S. wheat organizations said.     The recent Australian proposals were a good starting point for discussions, "but we do not want the Australians to feel they are alone in developing an agenda for discussions" on world grain trade, the president of the National Association of Wheat Growers, NAWG, and the chairman of U.S. Wheat Associates said in a letter to U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng and U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter.     Future discussions on international wheat trade should include three topics -- a commitment to privatization of government-run export trading entities, a commitment to public disclosure of sales and other terms if government entities are involved, and a recognition that supply reductions by the U.S. have kept world prices higher than they otherwise would be, the two organizations said      While the Australian proposals are welcome the two organizations said they are not in total agreement with their assessments.     Australia's proposals, which aim to reduce U.S. target prices and "quarantine" U.S. wheat stocks, would continue to place the burden of supply adjustment and reform on U.S. farmers, they said.       Other countries, including Australia, have benefitted from the higher world prices that have resulted from past U.S. acreage and crop reduction programs, the organizations said.     "We will not continue to hurt ourselves economically -- and subsidize foreign wheat production -- by unilaterally stocking grain and changing programs which protect our growers," Jim Miller, president of NAWG said.     "We sincerely hope for some type of agreement among the world's major grain producing nations to reduce stocks and restore profitability to agriculture," Miller said.  Reuter &#3;

However, final results will be affected by certain charges including legal and investment advisors fees, preferred stock dividends and other costs of restructuring, it said.     Expenses associated with restructuring are expected to be offset by "significant" gains from the sale of some of Gelco's business units, it said.

acq	PESCH SEES SHAREHOLDER SUPPORT IN AMI &lt;AMI> BID .  Chicago physician LeRoy Pesch said he has had discussions with several American Medical International Inc shareholders and sees support for a restructuring of the company.     Pesch said he has discussed his sweetened, 1.91 billion dlr takeover bid for American Medical with several large shareholders, including the biggest investor, the Bass family of Texas. However, the Bass family has not indicated support one way or the other for his offer, he said.     Pesch, in an interview with Reuters, said based on the conversations he held with shareholders, he could not guage whether he had majority support. He said, however, there is support for his offer.     Pesch would not identify shareholders with whom he held discussions other than the Bass family and the Wedge Group Inc, the only other holder of more than five pct of American Medical stock.     Earlier today, Wedge Group, which has a 5.5 pct stake,  said it held discussions with Pesch, American Medical management and other American Medical shareholders.     Wedge, in a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, said it believes a restructuring of American Medical and its business would be "highly desirable and appropriate at this time."     "That's the sort of position that I find a large segment of shareholders of AMI really share," said Pesch.     Pesch said he held discussions with Wedge about joining his takeover effort, in which he is offering 17 dlrs cash, four dlrs in preferred stock and one dlr in common stock for each American Medical share. Wedge said it has no plans to join in an effort to seek control of American Medical, but it would not rule out a future takeover try.     Pesch said he did not discuss a joint takeover proposal with the Bass family.     Some analysts saw the Wedge statement as a boost to Pesch's takeover effort and a further sign that there could be some shareholder dissatisfaction following American Medical's previous rejection of a 20 dlr per share all cash offer from Pesch.     American Medical is expected to resist Pesch's latest bid. Larry Feinberg, an analyst with Dean Witter Reynolds Inc said a management-led leveraged buyout cannot be ruled out.     An American Medical spokesman said the company will comment on the new Pesch offer by March 10.     Analysts continue to view the Bass family as a factor in the outcome of the bid for control of American Medical.     The Bass family holds an 11. 6 pct stake in American Medical, and the company has previously said the investors support management's internal plan to improve the company's performance. The Bass family would not comment on American Medical or Pesch.     Pesch, who led the leveraged buyout of Republic Health Corp last year, continues to face a credibilty problem on Wall Street because of the long time it took to finish the Republic acquisition.     Republic also has substantial debt, and has left wall street questioning whether financing can be completed for the much larger American Medical takeover proposal.     Pesch's first offer for American Medical was made without an investment banking firm, another cause for concern to Wall Street. However, Pesch entered his second offer with representation from Donaldson, Lufkin, and Jenrette Securities and Security Pacific Merchant Banking Group.     "I don't have any doubt that the current transaction can be worked out and completed, provided we get to the point where Ami management will sit down and talk in a friendly environment," Pesch said.     Pesch would not elaborate on what type of financing arrangements are being made. He did say if he succeeds in acquiring American Medical he plans to keep much of American Medical management in place.     He said he plans to combine the company with Republic to form an efficient network of hospitals.     Analysts said they do not believe a much higher offer could be made for American Medical.     Byron Nimocks of E.F. Hutton Group said improved second fiscal quarter earnings could make American Medical stock worth about 20 dlrs per share.     Nimocks estimates American Medical earnings for the second quarter ended February 28 could be 35 cts, compared to a 95 ct loss last year.     Nimocks said Pesch's revised offer is not worth much more than the 20 dlrs cash offered previously.     But Feinberg said there is a better chance a transaction could be completed because of the revised structure of the offer. "I think it's much more doable," he said.     Analysts have said American Medical has begun a turnaround by replacing some members of management and reducing costs.  Reuter &#3;

acq	ANALYSTS SEE NO OTHER BIDDER FOR PUROLATOR&lt;PCC> .  Several analysts said they do not believe another suitor will top the 265 mln dlr bid for Purolator Courier Corp by E.F. Hutton LBO Inc and a management group from Purolator's courier division.     There had been speculation another offer might be forthcoming, but analysts mostly believe the 35 dlrs per share price being paid by Hutton and the managers' PC Acquisition Inc is fully valued.     Analysts and some Wall Street sources said they doubted another bidder would emerge since Purolator had been for sale for sometime before a deal was struck with Hutton Friday.     Purolator's stock slipped 3/8 today to close at 34-3/4. It had been trading slightly higher than the 35 dlr offer on Friday. At least one analyst Friday speculated the company might fetch 38 to 42 dlrs per share.     analysts and wall street sources doubted a competitive offer would emerge since the company has been for sale for sometime before the deal with Hutton was struck Friday.     Hutton had been in talks with Purolator's adviser, Dillon, Read and Co since late December, a Hutton spokesman said.     Hutton is offering 35 dlrs cash per share for 83 pct of the shares. If all shares are tendered, shareholders would receive 29 dlrs cash, six dlrs in debentures, and warrants for stock in a subsidiary of PC Acquisition containing the Purolator U.S. courier operation. Hutton values the warrants at two to three dlrs per share.     Wall Street sources also said today that a rival bidder might be discouraged by a breakup fee Purolator would have to pay if it ends its agreement with Hutton. The sources would not reveal the amount of the fee, which will be noted in documents on the transaction to be made public later this week.  Reuter &#3;

The New York Mercantile Exchange expects to submit a propane futures contract for federal regulatory approval within a few days, according to an exchange spokeswoman.     As previously announced, the Board of Governors of the exchange approved the contract last month. The exchange will now submit the contract to the Commodity Futures Trading Commission, according to the spokeswoman.     Contract specifications will resemble those of heating oil and gasoline futures. The contract size will be 1,000 barrels, or 42,000 U.S. gallons.     The minimum price fluctuation for the propane futures contract will be  0.01 cent per gallon, or 4.20 dlrs a barrel, according to the exchange.     The maximum daily price limit will be two cts a gallon on all contracts except spot. Trading will terminate on the last business day of the month preceding the delivery month.     The exchange said delivery will be F.O.B from the seller's pipeline, storage, or fractionation facility in Mont Belvieu, Texas, which has a direct pipeline access to the Texas Eastern Transmission Pipeline (TET) in Mont Beliview.     Delivery method will be by in-line or in-well transfer, inter-facility transfer or pumpover, or book transfer and cannot be done earlier than the tenth calendar day of the delivery month, according to the exchange. Deliveries must be completed no later than two business days prior to the end of the delivery month.     Buyers taking delivery of the propane must pay the seller by certified check and the deadline for payment is 1200 EST (noon) of the second business day following receipt of the propane.  Reuter &#3;
veg-oil,soy-oil,oilseed,soybean	YEUTTER BLASTS PROPOSED EC OILS AND FATS TAX .  U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter today said that if the European Community's Council of Ministers approves a tax on vegetable oils and fats, another major transatlantic trade row will erupt over agriculture.     In a statement issued by the trade representative's office following a speech to the American Soybean Association's board of directors, Yeutter said the proposed tax would have a severe impact on American soybean farmers, who export some 2.4 billion dlrs in soybeans and products annually to the EC.     "This is an unacceptable situation for us and its (vegetable oils tax) enactment would leave us no choice but to vigorously protect our trade rights and defend our access to the European market," Yeutter said.     Yeutter said the proposed vegetable oils tax would violate EC obligations under the GATT.     He said the effect of the tax would be to double the price of soyoil produced from imported soybeans, making margarine made from soyoil more expensive than tallow-based margarine, and closer in price to expensive European butter.     "I am astonished that the EC commission would propose such a provocative measure so soon after we successfully resolved the agricultural dispute over the enlargement of the EC to include Spain and Portugal," Yeutter said.     "It serves no purpose to embark on another confrontational course before the recent wounds have healed and as we are beginning to make progress on the Uruaguay round (of global trade talks)," he said.

Greece, responding to a warning by Turkey against conducting oil activities in the Aegean Sea, said today it had the right to decide where and how to do research or drilling work in the area.     A government spokesman said the Greek position was made clear to Turkey's ambassador Nazmi Akiman when he met Greek Foreign Affairs Undersecretary Yannis Kapsis last week.     Acting Turkish Prime Minister Kaya Erdem said earlier today Greek activities in the northern Aegean contravened the 1976 Berne Agreement which set the framework for talks on the Aegean continental shelf disputed between Ankara and Athens.     The Greek statement today said, "Greece is not prepared to give up even a trace of its sovereignty rights to the seabed. It has been stressed to...Mr Akiman that the decision where or how to drill belongs exclusively to the Greek government."     "The Greek government has repeatedly let the Turkish side know that it considers the 1976 Berne protocol as inactive through the fault of Turkey," it said.     The Greek statement said Athens was ready to put the continental shelf issue before international courts.  Reuter &#3;

Producers and consumers could not find common ground on the issue of quota distribution in eight days of arduous, often heated talks, delegates said.

gnp,trade	FRANCE HAS LITTLE ROOM FOR MANOEUVRE, OECD SAYS .  French industry is failing to produce the goods its markets need and its loss of competitiveness has left the government little room for manoeuvre to reflate the economy, the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development said.     With gross domestic product likely to grow only 2.1 pct this year, the same rate as last year, unemployment could climb to 11.5 pct of the workforce by mid-1988, from its present 10.9 pct, it said in an annual review of the French economy.     The report said the French economy was "increasingly ill-adapted to demand" selling goods at "uncompetitive relative prices on both domestic and export markets."     "France's poor export performance reflects a geographical bias in favour of markets less dynamic than the average... And...A substantial loss of market share...In the past 18 months," it said.     Pointing to a likely widening of the French trade deficit to around 2.9 billion dlrs this year from 2.4 billion in 1986, it warned that a further depreciation of the dollar against the franc could lead to "a (renewed) loss of competitiveness relative not only to the United States but also to the newly industrialised countries."     This could result in further major losses of market share, particularly in the non-OECD area, which accounts for almost a quarter of French exports, it said.     Until the competitive ability of industry improved, the authorities would have "little scope for macroeconomic manoeuvre, even if the unemployment situation or the need to encourage a pickup in investment could require demand to grow more briskly," it added.     But rising unemployment could help to hold down wage demands, contributing to a slowdown in inflation to around a two pct annual rate this year and early next, the OECD said.     Written mainly in December last year, the report took no account of a rise in oil prices early in 1987, and a 0.9 pct surge in January consumer prices, caused partly by the government's deregulation of service sector tariffs.     "We took a bet that the freeing of prices would not provoke runaway rises, and it is not absolutely certain that bet has been lost," one OECD official commented.     OECD officials said the January data and a rise in oil prices above the 15 dlrs a barrel average assumed in the report, indicated an upward revision in the inflation forecast to around 2.5 or three pct.     The government last week revised its forecast up to between 2.4 and 2.5 pct from two pct, against last year's 2.1 pct.     But the OECD backed the government's view that the underlying trend for inflation remained downwards this year, with a slowdown in domestic costs taking over from last year's fall in oil and commodity prices as the chief cause of disinflation.     With French unit productivity costs now among the lowest in the OECD area, the inflation differential between France and its main trading rival, West Germany, could fall to just one pct this year, it said.     On the other hand, the report noted, consumer prices for industrial goods and private services have been rising steeply as companies built up their profits.     "For the disinflationary process to continue , and price competitiveness to become lastingly compatible with exchange rate stability, it is essential that wage restraint continue," it said.

acq	SEC PROBES 1986 TRE &lt;TRE> TAKEOVER ATTEMPT .  The federal Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) is looking for possible securities laws violations in connection with an unsuccessful 1986 bid by Hollywood producer Burt Sugarman to take over TRE Corp, attorneys contacted by SEC investigators said.     During the takeeover attempt, a unit of Sugarman's Giant Group Ltd at one point held a 9.9 pct stake in TRE.     It had help in that effort from Jefferies Group Inc, a Los Angeles investment banking firm which sold it an option on a portion of the shares Sugarman eventually acquired.     In addition, a company controlled by Sugarman raised 35 mln dlrs in a debt offering underwritten by Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc with help from Jefferies, and used a portion of the proceeds to buy TRE stock.     Finally, Reliance Group Holdings Inc acquired nearly six pct of TRE, according to an SEEC filing.     The attorneys, who asked not to be identified, said the SEC was investigating whether Sugarman and other firms with TRE holdings were working together without disclosing their cooperation, as would be required by the federal securities laws.     One attorney said SEC probers also were examining whether Sugarman and Drexel had made adequate disclosures of its intended usage of the proceeds in the prospectus for the 35 mln dlr bond offering.     A TRE spokesman confirmed that TRE, since December a unit of Aluminum Co of America, had been contacted by SEC investigators and was cooperating with the probe.     The spokesman added that TRE Chairman Leopold Wyler had been interviewed by the SEC probers.     A Jefferies spokesman said the SEC had asked for information a few months ago as part of an informal probe.     The spokesman said Jefferies had cooperated with the agency and had heard nothing more since that time.     "To the best of our knowledge, Jefferies is not the target of a formal SEC investigation" in connection with the TRE bid, he said.     A Drexel spokesman acknowledged that his firm had underwritten the debt offering for Sugarman but added:     "We had nothing to do with TRE."     As a matter of policy, the SEC routinely declines to comment on its enforcement activities.  Reuter &#3;

grain,wheat	USSR WHEAT BONUS RUMORS PERSIST DESPITE DENIALS .  Grain trade representatives continued to speculate that the Reagan administration will offer subsidized wheat to the Soviet Union, while U.S. Agriculture Department officials said there was no substance to the reports.     "It's pure fiction," said one senior official at USDA's Foreign Agricultural Service, referring to the rumor that the administration would make an export enhancement offer to Moscow in the next two to three weeks.     An aide to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng who asked not to be identified said there was nothing to substantiate the speculation, which he said was started by "somebody fanning the (wheat) market." Wheat futures strengthened today, partly on the basis of the speculation.     One lobbyist with close connections to the Reagan administration said a Soviet trade team told private grain trade officials in New York last week that Moscow would buy as much as four mln tonnes of U.S. wheat, much of it before mid-year, if it was "competitively priced."     Alexander Ivlev, an official with Amtorg, a Soviet trading organization, told Reuters he had no information to substantiate the rumors of an imminent wheat subsidy offer, but said that Moscow "would consider" buying U.S. wheat if it was competitively priced.     "We don't care if it is EEP, what we (the Soviets) are looking for is competitive prices," Ivlev said. "If they (the administration) are interested in selling it (wheat), they should find ways to do it."  Reuter &#3;

January's record 3.0 pct unemployment rate mainly stemmed from loss of jobs in manufacturing industries, particularly in export-related firms, due to the yen's continuing appreciation against the dollar, officials said.     Employment in manufacturing industries fell 380,000 from a year earlier to 14.30 mln including 1.83 mln employed in the textile industry, down 190,000 from a year earlier, and 1.06 mln in transport industries such as carmakers and shipbuilders, down 170,000.

The yen should stabilize at around 152 to 153 to the U.S. Dollar for about a year, the Bank of Tokyo's economic adviser Koei Narusawa said.     "Both sides are showing clear interest to secure stability of the currencies. The major target of the Japanese government is to maintain the yen at above 150, at least for the rest of the year," he told reporters during a brief visit to Malaysia.     Narusawa said the U.S. Is unlikely to push the yen up further because this might spark off inflation and depress the U.S. Economy before the 1988 presidential election.

crude	OPEC WITHIN OUTPUT CEILING, SUBROTO SAYS .  Opec remains within its agreed output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels a day, and had expected current fluctuations in the spot market of one or two dlrs, Indonesian Energy Minister Subroto said.     He told reporters after meeting with President Suharto that present weakness in the spot oil market was the result of warmer weather in the U.S. And Europe which reduced demand for oil.     Prices had also been forced down because refineries were using up old stock, he said.     He denied that Opec was exceeding its agreed production ceiling. Asked what Opec's output level was now, he replied: "Below 15.8 (mln barrels per day)." He did not elaborate.     He said there appeared to have been some attempts to manipulate the market, but if all Opec members stick by the cartel's December pricing agreement it would get through present price difficulties.     He predicted that prices would recover again in the third and fourth quarters of 1987.     He also reiterated that there was no need for an emergency Opec meeting.     He said Opec had expected to see some fluctuations in the spot price. "We hope the weak price will be overcome, and predict the price will be better in the third and fourth quarters."     Refiners, he said, appeared to have used up old stock deliberately to cause slack demand in the market and the price to fall. But Opec would get through this period if members stuck together.

grain,wheat	OFFICIAL INQUIRY SET FOR AUSTRALIAN WHEAT INDUSTRY .  The government's industry aid and protection review body, the Industries Assistance Commission (IAC), will hold a 12-month inquiry into the Australian wheat industry, Primary Industry Minister John Kerin said.     The IAC has been asked to report on the need for assistance to the industry and the nature, duration and extent of any aid, he said in a statement.     He said the inquiry will be the first step in setting marketing arrangements to apply after June 30, 1989, when the underwriting and pricing provisions of the 1984 Wheat Marketing Act expire.     Kerin said the broad-ranging reference would allow a full examination of all aspects of the wheat-marketing system.     "The inquiry will be required to take into account changes which have taken place in the industry as a result of the agricultural policies of major wheat producing countries and the industry's capacity to adjust to any recommended changes," he said.     "The inquiry is at an important time for the wheat industry, as the substantial fall in world prices is likely to trigger underwriting support from the government for the first time," he said.     Kerin was referring to the government's underwriting of the guaranteed minimum price paid to wheatgrowers by the Australian Wheat Board near the start of the season.     The IAC's report will be due at the same time as the findings of the current Royal Commission into Grain Storage, Handling and Transport, Kerin said.     He said the timing of the IAC inquiry would allow its findings and those of the Royal Commission to be considered in later negotiations on wheat-marketing arrangements between the federal and state governments and the industry.

coffee	COFFEE TRADERS EXPECT SELLOFF AFTER ICO TALKS FAIL .  The failure of the International Coffee Organization (ICO) to reach agreement on coffee export quotas could trigger a massive selloff in London coffee futures of at least 100 stg per tonne today, coffee trade sources said.     Prices could easily drop to as low as 1.00 dlr or even 80 cents a lb this year from around 1.25 dlrs now, they said.     A special meeting between importing and exporting countries ended in a deadlock late yesterday after eight days of talks over how to set the quotas. No further meeting to discuss quotas was set, delegates said.     Quotas, the major device used to stabilize prices under the International Coffee Agreement, were suspended a year ago after prices soared following a damaging drought in Brazil.     With no propects for quotas in sight, heavy producer selling initially and a price war among commercial coffee roasting companies will ensue, the trade sources predicted.     Lower prices are sure to trickle down to the supermarket shelf this spring, coffee dealers said.     The U.S. And Brazil, the largest coffee importer and exporter respectively, each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown of the talks.     Jon Rosenbaum, U.S. Assistant trade representative and delegate to the talks, said in a statement after the council adjourned, "A majority of producers, led by Brazil, were not prepared to negotiate a new distribution based on objective criteria.     "We want to insure that countries receive export quotas based on their ability to supply the market, instead of their political influence in the ICO."     Brazilian Coffee Institute (IBC) President Jorio Dauster countered, "Negotiations failed because consumers tried to dictate quotas, not negotiate them."     Previously, quotas were determined by historical amounts exported, which gave Brazil a 30 pct share of a global market of about 58 mln 60-kilo bags. A majority of producers wanted quotas to continue under this basic scheme.     But most consumers and a maverick group of eight producers proposed carving up the export market on the basis of exportable production and stocks, which would reduce Brazil's share to 28.8 pct.     Consumer delegates said this method would reflect changes in many countries' export capabilities and make coffee more readily available to consumers when they need it.     A last-minute attempt by Colombia, the second largest exporter, to rescue the talks with a compromise interim proposal could not bring the two sides together.     Delegates speculated Brazil's financial problems, illustrated by its recent suspension of interest payments on bank debt, have increased political pressure on the country to protect its coffee export earnings.     Developing coffee-producing countries that depend heavily on coffee earnings, particularly some African nations and Colombia, are likely to be hurt the most by the ICO's failure to agree quotas, analysts said.     The expected drop in prices could result in losses of as much as three billion dlrs in a year, producer delegates forecast.     The ICO executive board will meet March 31, but the full council is not due to meet again until September, delegates said.  REUTER &#3;

jobs	JAPAN'S UNEMPLOYMENT RATE SEEN RISING TO 3.5 PCT .  Japan's unemployment rate is expected to continue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year from January's three pct record, senior economists, including Susumu Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan, said.     December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling statistics under its current system in 1953.     "There is a general fear that we will become a country with high unemployment," said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist for the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.     The government, which published the January unemployment figures today, did not make any predictions.     "At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment rate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situation improving," a Labour Ministry official said.     Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000 people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April.     Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms.     The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries, such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employees and ceased hiring, economists said.     Although the growing service industry sector has absorbed a great number of workers the trend is starting to slow down, said Koichi Tsukihara, Deputy General Manager of Sumitomo Bank Ltd's economics department.     However, other economists disagreed, saying the service sector would be able to hire workers no longer needed by the manufacturing sector over the next five years.     The economists said the service sector should grow as the government stimulates domestic demand under its program to transform the economy away from exports.     Although Japanese unemployment rates appear lower than those of other industrialised nations, methods for calculating statistics make them difficult to compare, economists warned.     "The three pct figure  could translate into a relatively high figure if European methods were used," one economist said. More than half of January's 170,000 increase in jobless from a year earlier were those aged between 15 and 24, Sumitomo's Tsukihara said.  REUTER &#3;

trade	JAPAN MOVES TO TIGHTEN CHIP-EXPORT CURBS .  The Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI) acted to tighten restrictions on microchip exports to countries other than the U.S. To preserve a U.S.-Japan pact on semiconductor trade, but major Japanese chipmakers doubt its usefulness.     A MITI spokesman said his ministry had asked chipmakers to issue certificates to specified trading houses stating they are authorised exporters.     Trading houses applying for a MITI export licence will be required to show such a certificate, but those without it will not automatically be denied licences, he said.     But some industry officials predicted any government measures were likely to have limited effect as long as the world semiconductor market remained weak.     U.S. Government and industry officials have complained repeatedly that Japanese chipmakers continue to sell at below cost to third countries despite the July agreement.     Japanese firms and officials in turn argue the flow of cheap chips to third countries is due to grey-market sales by third-party brokers, who seek to profit from the gap between low prices in Japan and higher prices based on production costs and set for Japanese makers under the agreement.     The MITI spokesman said, "If the percentage of grey market is increasing for one specific company, it suggests they are distributing their products through their sales network knowing they will be exported by some means. In that case we will ask them what they are doing to reduce the figure."     MITI earlier asked makers to cut output of certain chips by 10 pct in first-quarter 1987, spokesmen for the firms said.     But they doubt the usefulness of the latest move. "As long as there is a gap between prices set under the pact and market prices, there will be people who want to exploit the gap to make money," a Hitachi Ltd &lt;HIT.T> spokesman said.  REUTER &#3;

Thailand's improving economy will likely cause foreign reserves to increase to at least five billion dlrs by end-1987 from a record of nearly 4.2 billion at end-February, private bankers said.     Bank of Thailand statistics show foreign reserves rose to 3.95 billion at end-January from 3.03 billion a year earlier.     Nimit Nonthapanthawat, chief economist at the &lt;Bangkok Bank Ltd>, said Thailand's strong export performance, its relatively high interest rates, foreign participation in its stock market, and growing foreign investment, especially from Japan, contributed to the projected sharp rise.     Thai exports rose 19.4 pct in 1986 and are expected to expand another 15 pct this year, bankers said.     A U.S. Embassy report said last month Thailand could achieve five pct real gross domestic product growth in 1987, up from a projection of 3.8 pct for 1986 and 3.7 pct in 1985.     Nonthapanthawat said if economic growth continues at its current pace and oil prices and major currencies remain stable the five billion 1987 reserves target can easily be reached.     Thailand calculates foreign reserves to include gold, special drawing rights and convertible currencies. The target is equivalent to five-and-a-half months' worth of imports.  REUTER &#3;

The Philippines must devalue the peso if it wants its exports to remain competitive, Economic Planning Secretary Solita Monsod told Reuters.     "The peso/dollar rate has to be undercut to make our exports more competitive," Monsod said an interview. "No question about it. I'm saying you cannot argue with success. Taiwan, South Korea, West Germany, Japan, all those miracle economies deliberately undervalued their currencies."     The peso has been free-floating since June 1984. It is currently at about 20.50 to the U.S. Dollar.     Finance Secretary Jaime Ongpin has said the government does not intend to devalue the peso and wants it to be flexible and able to continue to respond to market conditions.     Monsod said Ongpin was looking at the exchange rate from the point of view of finance. "If the dollar rate goes higher, our debt service in terms of pesos gets higher, so the financing is very difficult," she said. "But I am looking at it in terms of the economy."     She said she was not trying to oppose official policy.     "I'm just saying, keep it competitive. I do not want it to become uncompetitive because then we are dead."     Monsod said, "The ideal movement in the peso/dollar rate is a movement that will reflect differences in inflation (rates) of the Philippines versus the other country. It's an arithmetic thing."     Official figures show Philippine inflation averaged 0.8 pct in calendar 1986. Ongpin told reporters on Saturday it was expected to touch five pct this year.     He said the government and the International Monetary Fund had set the peso/dollar 1987 target rate at 20.80.     The peso lost 22.2 pct in value to slump to 18.002 to the dollar when it was floated in 1984.  REUTER &#3;

Mexican state oil firm Petroleos Mexicanos (Pemex) signed for a 500 mln dlr&#127;untied loan from the Export-Import Bank of Japan to finance its Pacific Petroleum Project, Pemex Japan representative Tito Ayal said.     No further details on the loan were immediately available.     Ayala told an oil seminar the project, due for completion in 1988, is aimed at improving distribution of oil products in the domestic market, mainly along the Pacific coast.     The project consists of a pipeline linking Nueva Teapa on the Gulf of Mexico with Salina Cruz on the Pacific Coast, and construction of the second phase of the Salina Cruz refinery.     The project also includes construction of liquified petroleum gas (LPG) storage tanks at Santa Cruz, additional crude oil storage at both ends of the pipeline, an ammonia complex at Lazaro Cardenas on the Pacific Coast and expansion of the infrastructure of the port of Salina Cruz, Ayala said.     Pemex will buy 80 mln dlrs worth of foreign equipment and materials for the project, he said. The new pipeline will enable Japan to load Mexico's Maya crude oil at Salina Cruz rather than in the Gulf of Mexico. Pemex will also have some LPG surplus available in Salina Cruz that may help Japan diversify its supply sources of that product, he added.  REUTER &#3;

earn,alum	COMALCO SAYS LOWER COSTS HELPED RETURN TO PROFITS .  Comalco Ltd &lt;CMAC.S> said its return to profit reflected reduced costs, improved primary aluminium prices and its withdrawal from a Japanese smelter venture.     It said the earlier reported 57.1 mln dlr profit for the year ended December 31 against a 69.13 mln dlr loss in 1985 was also aided by lower interest rates on U.S. Dollar debt and greater sales of bauxite and aluminium.     Comalco said it expected to pay at least a four cents per share final, dividend delayed until July 1 to take advantage of proposed dividend imputation laws.     This would make five cents for the year against a first and final of one cent in 1985.     Comalco said the aluminium industry continued to suffer from low prices and excess capacity, though the weak Australian dollar had helped earnings.     Withdrawal from the &lt;Showa Aluminium Industries KK> joint venture had been recapitalised in expansion by the &lt;New Zealand Aluminium Smelters Ltd> project with Japan's &lt;Sumitomo Aluminium Smelting Co Ltd>, permitting repayments and increases in liquid funds totalling 165 mln dlrs, it said.     As previously reported Comalco's &lt;Commonwealth Aluminium Corp> unit has conditionally agreed to sell its smelter at Goldendale, Washington, and port facilities at Portland, Oregon to &lt;Columbia Aluminium Corp>.     Comalco said it had made a 27.3 mln dlr extraordinary provision for Goldendale losses and closure costs but that if the sales agreement were completed it would reduce the provision made in the 1986 accounts.     The other items in the total extraordinary loss of 140.5 mln dlrs were a 102.9 mln write-off of unrealised exchange losses and 10.3 mln for an increase in future tax provision.  REUTER &#3;
earn	CRA EXPECTS TO PAY FINAL DIVIDEND OF 10 CENTS .  CRA Ltd &lt;CRAA.S> said it expected to pay a final 1986 dividend of not less than 10 cents a share after July 1, making 13 cents for&#127;the year against 15 in 1985.     The mining and smelting group earlier reported 1986 net earnings rose to 138.2 mln dlrs from 87.8 mln in 1985, against analysts' forecasts yesterday of 125 mln to&#127;160 mln.     CRA said it was deferring consideration of a dividend until later this year to provide the benefit of dividend imputation to its shareholders. After July 1, dividends will be tax-free to shareholders provided they come out of earnings on which the full 49 pct company tax rate has been p&#127;id.     The company operates on a substituted tax year, not the fiscal year ending June 30, and as a result has incurred tax at the 49 pct rate on 1986 earnings, CRA said in a statement.     Consequently, it has funds available for distribution with dividend imputed but is waiting to see the imputation legislation before determining the final payout, it said.     Despite the higher net earnings, CRA said 1986 was a poor year for the minerals industry, with the notable exception of gold producers.     Prices for major metals expressed in real U.S. Dollars declined to the lowest levels in about 50 years, it said.     Fluctuating exchange and interest rates added volatility and uncertainty, while the revaluation of the yen is leading to substantial restructuring of Japanese industry, CRA said.     World demand for metals is growing slowly. Inventories have steadily declined, with supply and demand in better balance, but overcapacity continues, CRA said.     Turning to contributions to its earnings, CRA said Bougainville Copper Ltd &lt;BUVA.S> contributed 31.3 mln dlrs while its share of Comalco Ltd's &lt;CMAC.S> net was 37.8 mln.     Net earnings from iron-ore operations were 111.8 mln dlrs against 149.2 mln in 1985, it said.     Lead, zinc and silver mining and smelting operations incurred a net loss of 66.8 mln dlrs against a 38.1 mln loss in 1985, CRA said.     Coal activities resulted in a net profit of 36.7 mln dlrs against 34.1 mln, while salt raised its contribution to 4.7 mln from 2.8 mln.     CRA's share of earnings from the Argyle diamond project amounted to 12.0 mln dlrs against nine mln in 1985.     CRA said the main item in its 250.28 mln dlr extraordinary loss was a 172.9 mln writeoff of unrealised foreign exchange losses on borrowings as required by a new accounting standard.     Other extraordinary items were 63.3 mln dlrs provided for closures and writedown of assets and a 14.1 mln increase in future tax provisions, CRA said.     Cash flow continued at a high level, being 950.6 mln dlrs before capital expenditure against 1.02 billion in 1985. The strong cash flow, coupled with the proceeds of the 1986 rights issue and the use of existing cash balances, enabled group debt to be reduced by nearly 500 mln dlrs.     CRA said it held forward contracts at year-end to buy 985 mln U.S. Dlrs to hedge part of its foreign debt. This cost 47.0 mln dlrs after tax, included in the net interest cost.  REUTER &#3;

trade	CHINA CALLS FOR BETTER TRADE DEAL WITH U.S. .  China called on the United States to remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology.     But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing 13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade Congress to change laws which limit its exports.      The official International Business newspaper today published China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with the visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.      "It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its restrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese exports," the editorial said.      "The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).      "Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries," it added      The paper also printed an article by China's commercial counsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said that "all kinds of difficulties and restrictions" were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential.      He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs on technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation.      The paper also printed a table showing that, since bilateral trade began in 1972, China has had a deficit every year except 1972 and 1977. It shows the 1986 and 1985 deficits at 2.09 billion and 1.722 billion dlrs.      A U.S. Embassy official said the U.S. Did not accept Peking's trade figures at all, mainly because they exclude goods shipped to Hong Kong and then trans-shipped to U.S. While U.S. Figures are based on country of origin.      He said that, if China wants to obtain GSP status, it will have to lobby Congress itself to persaude it to amend several laws which currently prevent Peking getting such status.      The U.S. Trade Act of 1974 says that to qualify for GSP, China must be a member of the General Agreement of Tariffs and Trade (GATT), for which it applied in July 1986, and "not be dominated or controlled by international Communism."      The official said China was well aware of the laws, some of which date to the anti-Communist early 1950's, but that there is not sufficient political will in the U.S. To change them.      China has been the subject of about a dozen cases involving anti-dumping in the U.S. Within the last two years, which the U.S. Side won, he said.      But, for the first time, China signed last week an agreement which it itself initiated to voluntarily restrain exports of at least two categories of steel goods, which may lead the U.S. Side to withdraw the anti-dumping case, he added.      Another diplomat said willingness to provide such voluntary export restraints would be an important issue in bilateral trade issues and in Peking's application to GATT.      "China has the potential to disrupt world markets, especially in textiles. Other GATT countries will be nervous about China in this respect. But there is a precedent for other centralled planned economies in GATT," the diplomat said.      Poland, Czechoslovakia, Hungary and Romania are members of GATT but none has China's massive market potential for imports or its vast labour pool to produce cheap exports.      In a speech today in the northeast city of Dalian, U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz said his country welcomed China's interest in participating in GATT.      "The process of Chinese accession will not be accomplished overnight -- the GATT rules were not designed for a large economy of the Chinese type," Shultz said.      "China can play an important role by actively joining GATT discussions seeking to expand general trading opportunities and enhance market access for exports worldwide. China can further develop its foreign trade system so as to gain the maximum benefit from its GATT participation," he said.      The problems facing U.S.-China trade and GATT membership are similar -- a pricing system which many foreign businessmen regard as arbitrary and not related to actual costs, especially for exports, and a de facto dual currency system.      In a memorandum backing its application presented to GATT last month, China said it was gradually reforming its economic system and replacing mandatory instruction with "guidance planning" and economic levers.      The diplomat said that, to join GATT, China had much to do.  REUTER &#3;
interest,money-fx	NO BUNDESBANK POLICY CHANGES EXPECTED THURSDAY .  The Bundesbank is unlikely to change its credit policies at its central bank council meeting on Thursday, as exchange rates and short-term interest rates have stabilized over the past few weeks, money market dealers said.     Attention in the money market is focused on tomorrow's tender for a securities repurchase pact, from which funds will be credited on Thursday, when an earlier pact expires, draining 16 billion marks from the system.     The tender was announced last Friday, because carnival festivities closed banks in Duesseldorf yesterday, and will close banks here this afternoon.     Because of the disruption to business from carnival, minimum reserve figures for the start of the month are unrealistic, making it difficult for banks to assess their needs at the tender.     Dealers said the Bundesbank would want to inject enough liquidity in this week's pact to keep short-term rates down.     But because of uncertainty about banks' current holdings, the Bundesbank may well allocate less than 16 billion marks this week, and top it up if necessary at next week's tender.     "I would not be surprised if the Bundesbank cuts the amount a little, to say 14 or 15 billion marks," one dealer said.     "They would then stock it up at the next tender when the need is clearer," he added.     An earlier pact expires next week, draining 8.5 billion marks from the system. Banks also face a heavy but temporary drain this month from a major tax deadline for customers.     Banks held 52.0 billion marks on February 27 at the Bundesbank, averaging 51.0 billion over the whole month, just clear of the 50.5 billion February reserve requirement.

reserves	U.K. RESERVES SHOW UNDERLYING RISE IN FEBRUARY .  Britain's gold and currency reserves showed an underlying rise of 287 mln dlrs in February, after a 72 mln dlrs rise in January, the Treasury said.     The underlying trend, which is a guide to Bank of England operations to support the pound on foreign exchanges, is net of borrowings and repayments.     This was above market expectations for a 100 mln dlrs rise.     The Treasury said the Bank of England used the opportunity of strong demand to rebuild reserves after losses last autumn and said the underlying rise was still relatively modest.     Actual reserves rose by 305 mln dlrs in February to 22.26 billion dlrs, after rising 29 mln in January to 21.95 billion.     Accruals of borrowings under the exchange cover scheme were 36 mln dlrs last month, after 163 mln in January, while repayments were 16 mln dlrs after the previous 151 mln, a Treasury spokesman said.     Capital repayments totalled two mln dlrs. In January, capital repayments totalled 14 mln dlrs, with a valuation change that resulted in a fall of 41 mln dlrs due to the quarterly rollover from the European Monetary Cooperation Fund swap.     The Treasury would not comment on the Bank of England's market operations, but currency traders reported moderate Bank of England intervention to curb upward pressure on the pound today.     A Treasury spokesman, commenting on the reserves figures, said that the government does not want sterling either to rise too far or to fall substantially from current levels.     He noted that the Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson stressed this after the recent Paris currencies meeting.     REUTER &#3;

Japan's unemployment rate is expected to continue to climb to about 3.5 pct within the next year from January's three pct record, senior economists, including Susumu Taketomi of Industrial Bank of Japan, said.     December's 2.9 pct was the previous worst level since the government's Management and Coordination Agency began compiling statistics under its current system in 1953.     "There is a general fear that we will become a country with high unemployment," said Takashi Kiuchi, senior economist for the Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan Ltd.     The government, which published the January unemployment figures today, did not make any predictions.     "At present we do not have a forecast for the unemployment rate this year, but it is difficult to foresee the situation improving," a Labour Ministry official said.     Finance Minister Kiichi Miyazawa said the government had expected the increase and had set aside money to help 300,000 people find jobs in fiscal 1987 beginning in April.     Prime Minister Yasuhiro Nakasone told a press conference the record rate underlines the need to pass the 1987 budget which has been held up by opposition to proposed tax reforms.     The yen's surge has caused layoffs in the mainstay steel and shipbuilding industries. Other export-dependent industries, such as cars and textiles, have laid off part-time employees and ceased hiring, economists said.

The price of Hongkong and Shanghai Hotels Ltd &lt;SHLH.HK>'s stock soared on speculation of a takeover battle between major shareholders the Kadoorie family and the Evergo Industrial Enterprise Ltd &lt;EVGH.HK> group, stock brokers said.     They noted heavy buying in Hk Hotel shares after an announcement by Evergo's &lt;China Entertainment and Land Investment Co Ltd> unit that it bought about 20 pct of Hk Hotels from the firm's deputy chairman David Liang for 1.06 billion dlrs. The stock rose 12 H.K. Dlrs to 62 dlrs today.     Thomas Lau, Evergo's executive director, declined comment on whether the group is seeking a further stake in Hk Hotels. But he told Reuters the group will hold the 20 pct stake bought from Liang as long term investment.     He said Evergo "was attracted by the underlying strength of Hk Hotels."     Analysts said Evergo may be looking for a possible redevelopment of the Peninsula Hotel, one of Asia's best known hotels, and another site on Hong Kong island. Both are owned by Hk Hotels.     &lt;Lai Sun Garment Co ltd> yesterday said it acquired a 10 pct stake in Hk Hotels from Liang for 530 mln dlrs.     Lau denied any link between China Entertainment and Lai Sun on their acquisitions of the Hk Hotels stake.     "It is purely coincidence," he said.     But analysts were not so certain, saying that the Evergo group, which has a reputation as a corporate raider, may team up with Lai Sun Garment for a takeover.     Lau also denied any contact with the Kadoorie family, which analysts estimate has more than 20 pct of Hk Hotels. Michael Kadoorie is chairman of Hk Hotels.     Lau said two representatives of Evergo will be nominated to the Hk Hotels board.     A source close to the Kadoorie family said the family has not considered any countermoves so far.     Analysts said it would be difficult for Evergo and the Kadoorie family to cooperate because of different management styles.     "Evergo may want to split up the hotel management and property developments of Hk Hotels but that strategy may not fit the conservative Kadoorie family," said an analyst who asked not to be named.     Another analyst noted the price of Hk Hotels had been distorted by the takeover talks because its net asset value is only worth about 50 dlrs a share. The offers by Evergo and Lai Sun were for 53 dlrs a share, though that is well below the current trading price.     Trading was suspended today in shares of Lai Sun, Evergo, China Entertainment and the group's associate &lt;Chinese Estates Ltd>.

ship	NEITHER SIDE OPTIMISTIC ON ROTTERDAM PORT ISSUES .  Employers and the port union, FNV, are to meet again this afternoon to attempt a settlement of the six-week-old dispute in Rotterdam's general cargo sector, but neither side is optimistic, spokesmen for both sides told Reuters.     Little progress was made in last night's three hours of talks, with both sides largely reiterating their positions.     "There is still a very large gap between the employers and the FNV, and I can't say that we expect to reach any agreement. But at least we are still talking," a union spokesman said.     Employers organization chairman, Jacques Schoufour, accused the FNV of intransigence in refusing to alter its stance at all over the past two months.     "The FNV is not serious about our discussions and I am really not optimistic about it changing its point of view at all."     "If we find this afternoon that the FNV still refuses to accept the necessary redundancies in the general cargo sector, then we will break off the talks and the redundancies may begin later this month," Schoufour said.     The series of strikes, which employers say has cost them more than seven mln guilders in lost import business in the past six weeks, began on January 19 in protest at plans for 800 redundancies from the sector's 4,000 workforce starting with 350 this year.     Late last month Social Affairs minister Louw de Graaf said unless the dispute was settled by yesterday he would withdraw the sector's 10 mln guilder annual labour subsidy.     Both sides wrote to the minister yesterday setting out their cases, but Schoufour said he did not expect to hear from him before Wednesday at the earliest.  Reuter &#3;
earn	UNILEVER IMPROVES IN MOST SECTORS DURING 1986 .  The Unilever Plc and NV &lt;UN.A> group saw improved performance in almost all sectors during 1986, the Anglo-Dutch group said in its results statement.     Very good progress was made last year, while the recent acquisition of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc &lt;CBM.N> was a significant addition which will greatly benefit the group in the years to come.     Earlier, Unilever reported combined fourth quarter pre-tax profit of 276 mln stg, level with the year earlier period, making 1.14 billion stg compared with 953 mln for the 1986 full year.     Unilever said it plans to change its depreciation policy to the more conventional practice of depreciating assets individually rather than depreciating fixed assets at average rates. The new method is expected to lead to a reduction in the accumulated provision for depreciation and thereby increase the net book value of tangible asssets by about 300 mln stg as at January 1, 1987.     Unilever Plc shares are up 25p since yesterday at 2,575p in buoyant response to the results and share split proposal, though 1986 profits were not ahead of market forecasts, dealers added.

lei	U.S. LEADING INDEX FELL 1.0 PCT IN JANUARY .  The U.S. index of leading indicators fell a seasonally adjusted 1.0 pct in January after a revised 2.3 pct December gain, the Commerce Department said.     The department previously said the index rose 2.1 pct in December.     The decline in January was the biggest for any month since July, 1984, when the index fell 1.7 pct.     The January decrease left the index at 183.8 over its 1967 base of 100, and was led by a fall in contracts and orders for plant and equipment.     A total of six of 10 indicators available for January contributed to the decline.     Besides contracts and orders for plant and equipment, they were building permits, manufacturers' new orders for consumer goods, a change in sensitive materials prices, slower deliveries from vendors and higher average weekly claims for state unemployment insurance.     Four of 10 indicators were positive, including stock prices, new business formation, average work week and money supply.     The main factor for the December upward revision was new business formation.     There was no revision in the 0.9 pct increase in the leading indicators index for November.     The index of coincident indicators, which measures the current economy, fell 0.1 pct in January after increases of 0.7 pct in December and 0.2 pct in November.     The index of lagging indicators, which measures past economic activity, rose 0.5 pct in January after a decrease of 0.5 pct in December and an increase of 0.2 pct in November.  Reuter &#3;

coffee	COFFEE PRICE FALL SHORT TERM - DUTCH ROASTERS .  This morning's sharp decline in coffee prices, following the breakdown late last night of negotiations in London to reintroduce International Coffee Organization, ICO, quotas, will be short-lived, Dutch roasters said.     "The fall is a technical and emotional reaction to the failure to agree on reintroduction of ICO export quotas, but it will not be long before reality reasserts itself and prices rise again," a spokesman for one of the major Dutch roasters said.     "The fact is that while there are ample supplies of coffee available at present, there is a shortage of quality," he said.     "Average prices fell to around 110 cents a lb following the news of the breakdown but we expect them to move back again to around 120 cents within a few weeks," the roaster added.     Dutch Coffee Roasters' Association secretary Jan de Vries said although the roasters were disappointed at the failure of consumer and producer ICO representatives to agree on quota reintroduction, it was equally important that quotas be reallocated on a more equitable basis.     "There is no absolute need for quotas at this moment because the market is well balanced and we must not lose this opportunity to renegotiate the coffee agreement," he said.     "There is still a lot of work to be done on a number of clauses of the International Coffee Agreement and we would not welcome quota reintroduction until we have a complete renegotiation," de Vries added.     With this in mind, and with Dutch roasters claiming to have fairly good forward cover, the buying strategy for the foreseeable future would probably be to buy coffee on a hand-to-mouth basis and on a sliding scale when market prices were below 120 cents a lb, roasters said.

The spokesman, reacting to Irish and British press reports, said "He continues to be interested were the group to offer the brewery side of Guinness for sale. But he has not put together a consortium, nor has he been buying shares."     He was quoted by the Irish magazine Business and Finance as saying he would be interested if it came on the market and that he had the support of two international banks if he decided such a purchase might be worthwhile.     In the magazine article, he suggested that if brewing profits were calculated to be in the region of 80 mln punts, the asking price would not be higher than 800 mln punts.     "A multiple of ten times earnings would be the top whack for the brewing division in the current Guinness situation," he said.     "This would mean an expensive exercise, right on the edge, but not impossible," he added.     The deal would mean buying the Dublin, London, Nigerian and Malaysian breweries because "It could only be sold as an integral unit if it was going to be sold at all," O'Reilly said.  Reuter &#3;

Equatorial Communications Co said it expects to report losses of about 57 mln dlrs for the fourth quarter and 68 mln dlrs for the full year 1986 on revenues of about 10 mln dlrs for the quarter and 52 mln dlrs for the year.     Equatorial said the losses will include a charge of about 45 mln dlrs from costs associated with the restructuring of its business, including adjustments to reflect the market value of transponders owned and leased by Equatorial and other reserves for inventory, receivables and excess facilities.     Equatorial said the fourth quarter operating results will also include restructuring costs of about 5,500,000 dlrs, in addition to the 45 mln dlr charge.     Equitorial also said that as of March One it is operating in technical default under its lease of transponders on the Galaxy III satellite due to its inabiliuty to maintain agreed-upon financial ratios.  It said it is in talks with the lessors in an attempt to restructure lease obligations.     Further, Equitorial said it is in default of two other oblitations in connection with the purchase or lease of transponders as a result of cross-default provisions.     Equatorial said it has signed a memorandum of understanding for Contel Corp &lt;CTC> to purchase 10 mln dlrs of Equatorial master earth stations, micro earth stations and associated equipment and loan Equatorial six mln dlrs over a six-month period for repayment starting in December 1988.     The company said Conteol, under the agreement, would assume a portion of Equatorial's rights and obligations under the Galaxy III transponder lease with &lt;Burnham Leasing> on the occurrence of certain events.     Equatorial said it would grant Contel an option to buy about 3,600,000 common shares at 3.25 dlrs each.     Equatorial said its understandings with Contel are subject to Equatorial's ability to restructure a significant portion of its obligations and to obtain concessions from lenders and lessors, in particular under its Galaxy III transponder lease. It said it hopes to finalize a Contel agreement by April 15.     Equatorial in 1985 earned 1,807,000 dlrs after a 3,197,000 dlr gain from early debt retirement on revenues of 56.1 mln dlrs. For the first nine months of 1986, the company lost 9,476,000 dlrs on revenues of 45.4 mln dlrs, compared with a 1,784,000 dlr profit after the early retirement gain on revenues of 38.5 mln dlrs.

He was also quoted as saying the U.S. Would be pleased were Japan to halve restrictions on agricultural imports within five years if the country cannot cope with abolition within three, the spokesman said.

Unilever Plc &lt;UN.A> and NV group reported improvements in margins and underlying sales volume growth of five pct in 1986 after stripping out the effects of falling prices, disposals and currency movements, Unilever Plc chairman Michael Angus said.     He told reporters that volumes in North America increased some 10.5 pct while European consumer goods rose about 2.5 pct after being flat for some years.     Much of the disposal strategy, aimed at concentrating activities on core businesses, had now been completed, he noted.     But the process of acquisitions would go on, with strategic acquisitions taking place "from time to time," he said.     The company earlier reported a 20 pct rise in pre-tax profits for 1986 to 1.14 billion stg from 953 mln previously. In guilder terms, however, profits at the pre-tax level dropped three pct to 3.69 billion from 3.81 billion.     Angus said the recent purchase of Chesebrough-Pond's Inc &lt;CBM.N> for 72.50 dlrs a share was unlikely to bring any earnings dilution.     However, it would not add much to profits, with much of the company's operating profits paying for the acquisition costs.     Finance director Niall Fitzgerald added that while gearing - debt to equity plus debt - rose to about 60 pct at end 1986 from 35 pct last year, this was expected to drop back to about 40 pct by end-1987.     The same divergence was made in full year dividend, with Unilever NV's rising 3.4 pct to 15.33 guilders and Unilever Plc's increasing 29.9 pct to 50.17p, approximately in line with the change in attributable profit.     Angus said the prospectus for the sale of parts of Chesebrough was due to be published shortly. However, he said that there was no target date for completing the process.     He also declined to say what sort of sum Unilever hoped to realise from the operation, beyond noting that Chesebrough had paid around 1.25 billion dlrs for Stauffer Chemical Co, which operates outside Unilever's core activities.     In the U.S., Organic growth from the Lipton Foods business, considerable expansion in the household products business and in margarine had been behind the overall sales increase.     However, he noted that the U.S. Household products business had turned in a planned loss, with fourth quarter performance better than expected despite the anticipated heavy launch costs of its Surf detergents.

China called on the United States to remove curbs on its exports, to give it favourable trading status and ease restrictions on exports of high technology.     But the U.S. Embassy replied that Chinese figures showing 13 years of trade deficits with the U.S. Out of the last 15 are inaccurate and said Peking itself would have to persuade Congress to change laws which limit its exports.     The official International Business newspaper today published China's demands in a  editorial to coincide with the visit of U.S. Secretary of State George Shultz.     "It is extremely important that the U.S. Market reduce its restrictions on Chinese imports, provide the needed facilities for them and businessmen from both sides help to expand Chinese exports," the editorial said.     "The U.S. Should quickly discard its prejudice against favourable tariff treatment for Chinese goods and admit China into the Generalised System of Preference (GSP).     "Despite easing of curbs on U.S. Technology exports in recent years, control of them is still extremely strict and influences normal trade between the two countries," it added.     The paper also printed an article by China's commercial counsellor in its Washington embassy, Chen Shibiao, who said that "all kinds of difficulties and restrictions" were preventing bilateral trade fulfilling its full potential.     He named them as U.S. Protectionist behaviour, curbs on technology transfer and out-of-date trade legislation.  Reuter &#3;

coffee,crude	KENYAN ECONOMY FACES PROBLEMS, PRESIDENT SAYS .  The Kenyan economy is heading for difficult times after a boom last year, and the country must tighten its belt to prevent the balance of payments swinging too far into deficit, President Daniel Arap Moi said.     In a speech at the state opening of parliament, Moi said high coffee prices and cheap oil in 1986 led to economic growth of five pct, compared with 4.1 pct in 1985.     The same factors produced a two billion shilling balance of payments surplus and inflation fell to 5.6 pct from 10.7 pct in 1985, he added.     "But both these factors are no longer in our favour ... As a result, we cannot expect an increase in foreign exchange reserves during the year," he said.     The price of coffee, Kenya's main source of foreign exchange, fell in London today to about 94 cents a pound from a peak of 2.14 dlrs in January 1986.     Crude oil, which early last year slipped below 10 dlrs a barrel, has since crept back to over 18 dlrs.     Moi said the price changes, coupled with a general decline in the flow of capital from the rest of the world, made it more difficult to finance the government's budget deficit.     Kenya was already spending over 27 pct of its budget on servicing its debts and last year it was a net exporter of capital for the first time in its history, he added.     "This is a clear indication that we are entering a difficult phase as regards our external debts, and it is imperative that we raise the rate of domestic savings and rely less on foreign sources to finance our development," he said.     "It will be necessary to maintain strict discipline on expenditure ... And members of this house will have to take the lead in encouraging wananchi (ordinary people) to be more frugal in satisfying immediate needs," the president added.  REUTER &#3;

Sales of new single-family homes in the United States fell 6.8 pct in January from December to a seasonally adjusted annual rate of 716,000 units, the Commerce Department said.     The department revised downward December's sales to a 12.1 pct rise to 768,000 units from the previously reported 12.7 pct increase.     The January decline in sales was the largest since last October when sales fell 9.3 pct.     Before seasonal adjustment, the number of homes actually sold in January was 53,000, up from 49,000 in December but down from 59,000 in January, 1986.     The January fall brought home sales to a level 1.6 pct below January, 1986, when they were a seasonally adjusted 728,000 units.     The average price was a record 127,100 dlrs, surpassing the previous record 119,100 price set in December.     The median price of a home in January reached 100,700 dlrs -- the first time the price has exceeded 100,000 dlrs. That compared with a median price of 94,600 dlrs in December and 94,000 dlrs in January a year ago.

Pharmacia AB &lt;PHAB ST> forecast earnings after financial items of one billion crowns in 1987 vs 821.2 mln last year on condition that exchange rates remained at their present parities.     Sales would in such circumstances go up to six billion crowns from 3.65 billion in 1986, it said.     A weakening Dollar was mainly responsible for a five pct negative impact on sales during 1986 which the company blamed on currency movements.     Last year's results were also badly hit by a once-off writedown of 520 mln crowns for intangible assets.     The company said mainly this represented the premium the group had paid for the know-how of various high-tech firms it had taken over.     The accounts also showed a financial deficit of 1.87 billion crowns vs a deficit of 133 mln which was covered partly by drawing down company liquidity to 738 mln vs one billion and partly by increasing borrowing to 2.23 billion vs 621 mln.     Pharmacia said the financial deficit was caused by it having used more funds than generated by group operations, mainly because of the 1.36 billion it paid in cash for shares in LKB-Produkter AB and the assets of Intermedics-Intraocular Inc.

There was no evidence of winterkill in Yugoslavian winter wheat during field travel along a line running northwest from Belgrade to near Maribor, the U.S. Agriculture Department's counselor in Belgrade said in a field report.     The report, dated February 26, said there is evidence of delayed germination in most areas due to late seeding last fall because of dry conditions.     However warm temperatures over the past three weeks have promoted some early growth and will help the crop catch up on last fall's late seeding, it said.     Some Yugoslav agriculture officials are concerned about the situation because warm temperatures have brought the grain out of dormancy and taken away snow protection a little early, the report said.     Cold temperatures over the next month could cause damage under these conditions, they said.     The report said all wheat farmers contacted during the field trip were optimistic about the crop and the way it emerged from winter.  Reuter &#3;

The insurance holding company had net earnings of 449.6 mln dlrs, or, or 7.42 per share, in 1986.     John Loynes, Continental chief financial officer, said the fresh start provision allowed the company to discount opening tax reserves to January 1, 1987, which released deferred taxes into earnings.     Loynes said the provision's potential benefit would decline gradually over the next four years, during which time Continental will pay 250 mln to 350 mln dlrs more in taxes.     Loynes added, however, the higher taxes are not expecetd to have a significant impact on earnings.  Reuter &#3;

Belgian Foreign Trade Minister Herman De Croo said he believed there would be a compromise within the European Community, EC, on its proposed tax on vegetable fats and oil, averting a pledged tough trade response by the United States.     De Croo, in Washington for talks with Administration officials and Congressional leaders, said at a news conference there is a battle within the community on the tax on fats and oils used in the 12 EC countries.     But he added, "I do not think it will be a big issue because there will be a big debate inside Europe," adding "so there will be a compromise."     U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said yesterday that if the community went ahead with the tax, the United States would respond "vigorously" to protect its trade rights and access to community markets.     De Croo also said he thought the community would postpone its April 28 deadline for imposing new slaughterhouse rules to cover all meats brought into EC nations if some progress was made toward resolving differences with the United States.     U.S. officials say its rules now meet health standards and the EC should require equivalent but not identical standards.     He also told reporters he hoped the community could deal with another controversial health proposal that would forbid the feeding of hormones to cattle, which is also opposed by the United States.     De Croo gave no deals on how he though the issue might be resolved. That rule is go into effect on January 1, 1988.     He said U.S. cattlemen say there is no reason to change slaughterhouse practices in April if the meat is to be banned a few months later by the hormone rule.  Reuter &#3;

Slightly more than half of this payment will be in cash, von Garlem said, but he said this will not markedly upset the 50/50 ratio, since most farmers got advance payments.

The bank's loan loss provision for the first quarter ended January 31 rose to 223 mln dlrs from 187 mln dlrs in the year-ago quarter.     The bank said non-accrual loans, net of provisions for loan losses, totalled 2.2 billion dlrs on January 31, up from 2.0 billion dlrs a year ago.     In reporting lower first quarter earnings, chairman Allan Taylor said problems with credit quality--particularly in loans associated with the energy sector--continue to have a substantial adverse effect on the bank's earnings.     Taylor said profitability of the bank's international operations remains weak, reflecting resource-related difficulties of private and public sector borrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market activities.

earn	ROYAL BANK SEES IMPROVED RESULTS .  &lt;Royal Bank of Canada>, in reporting a 19 pct drop in first quarter earnings, said it expects to report improved results in future earnings periods.     "Healthy consumer credit growth, record fee-based income, highly profitable securities and foreign exchange trading, and a solid capital position...combined with the restraint of non-interest expenses, should lead to improved results in the periods ahead," chairman Allan Taylor said in a statement.     The bank earlier reported profit for the first quarter ended January 31 fell to 114 mln dlrs from 140 mln dlrs a year ago.     Taylor said loans to the energy sector continue to substantially hurt earnings while profitability of the bank's international operations remains weak, reflecting resource-related difficulties of private and public sector borrowers and unsatisfactory results from capital market activities.     The bank said earnings from domestic operations rose to 103 mln dlrs in the first quarter from 98 mln dlrs a year ago while earnings from international operations plunged to 11 mln dlrs from 42 mln dlrs last year.     Royal Bank said first quarter international net interest income declined from last year, reflecting reduced revenues from international investment banking as well as a significant loss on disposal of its affiliate in Trinidad and Tobago.     Other income rose to 251 mln dlrs from 220 mln dlrs last year. The rise was due to higher commercial banking and retail deposit service fees, and higher foreign exchange revenue but lower securities commissions from international investment bank operations partly offset the gains, Royal Bank said.     The bank said a two billion dlr increase in total assets to 98.7 billion dlrs was due mainly to continued growth in consumer lending, particularly residential mortgages.  Reuter &#3;
trade	BELGIAN SAYS EC WOULD REACT TO TEXTILE BILL .  Belgian Foreign Trade Minister Herman De Croo said if Congress passed legislation curbing world textile imports the only way the European Community (EC) could react was to retaliate.     De Croo said at a news conference "if you limit textile imports, you will re-orient textiles to Europe."     And that he said would trigger EC taxes on U.S. goods.     Congress passed a textile bill two years ago, but it was vetoed by President Reagan on grounds that curbing imports to protect the domestic textile industry would trigger retaliation U.S. trading partners.     A similar bill has been introducted this year, in a Congress with a bigger Democratic majority and with a President weakened by the Iran scandal.     De Croo, here for talks with Administration officials and Congressmen, said if a textile bill passed, "the only way we could react would be retaliation, and it would cause more retaliation, which is not a good way to deal with problems."     He said if a textile bill was enacted, "we will impose taxes on a lot of American products."  He said "it would be stupid. We have to avoid that."     He said Congressmen seem upset mosty with Japan, because of its massive trade suprlus with the United States, and not with EC nations, but EC nations will be hurt by the diverted  shipments of Asian textiles.     De Croo also criticized the way U.S. officials try to solve EC trade issues, saying "each time we come in contact, it a conflict contact. The clouts are coming fom the West."     He said it then is a crisis atmosphere with officials cross the Atlantic and dramatized with headlines.     "This is not the way to work in a serious way between two big powers," De Croo said.      reuter &#3;

In remarks prepared for delivery before the National Press Club, Rostenkowski, D-Ill., predicted major trade legislation will be sent to President Reagan by the end of this year.     But he warned that his "conciliatory message" on the trade bill did not mean he would oppose a proposal that would warn other countries their access to the American market would be curtailed unless they opened their markets to U.S. goods.     "Complaints about (foreign trade) restraints are not a smoke screen for protectionism, they a plea for fairness," Rostenkowski said.     "It is only reasonable to ask the nations that have denied us access to open up in return for continued freedom in the American market," he added.     However, he said there would likely be changes in the market access proposal from the plan which cleared the House last year. That plan would have set a specific time table for foreign countries to ease import restraints or they would face a 25 pct cut in exports to the United States.  Reuter &#3;

Anacomp rose 1/2 to 6-3/4 on volume of 950,000 shares after trading as high as seven earlier.     Howard Harlow, analyst at Whale Securities Corp, said Anacomp's earnings for fiscal 1987 ending September 31 could be doubled to 80 cts a share from the 40 cts a share he had forecast before Anacomp agreed to buy DatagraphiX, a micrographics firm, from General Dynamics Corp &lt;GD>.     "The company can earn 80 cts a share in fiscal 1987, maybe as much as a dlr a share, because of DatagraphiX," Harlow said. "Most of the benefit will be in the fourth qtr because it will integrate the company in the second half."     Anacomp's earnings will be less if it has problems integrating DatagraphiX, Harlow said.     A spokesman at Anacomp said the company expects to complete its deal for DatagraphiX later this month. She would not say how much it will pay for DatagraphiX, but noted that DatagraphiX contributed 10 mln dlrs in earnings to General Dynamics on revenues of 239 mln dlrs in 1986.     Harlow said a fellow analyst at Whale Securities estimates that Anacomp will pay between 100 mln dlrs to 150 mln dlrs for DatagraphiX. "The estimates on the street narrow it down to between 110 mln dlrs and 130 mln dlrs," Harlow added.     Anacomp reported net of 2.8 mln dlrs or nine cts a share in its first qtr ended December 31, up from 301,000 dlrs or one ct a share.

trade	U.K. EXPORTS BODY GETS NEW EXECUTIVE DIRECTOR .  Export Credits Guarantee Department has named Malcolm Stephens, director of export finance at Barclay's Bank Plc and a former career civil servant at ECGD for 17 years, to the post of executive director, a department spokesman said.     Stephens replaces Jack Gill, who is retiring early aged 57.     A drop in the ECGD's business volume and a rise in its debt to the Exchequer have led to criticism in Parliament in recent years.     Stephens said the fall in business volume was a top convern, adding that the department may have to compete more aggressively with private insurance firms providing similar services.     The department's annual report for the year ended March 31, 1986, showed exports insured by the department fell to 15.7 billion stg from 17.4 billion the year before, while its debt to the Exchequer almost doubled to 756 mln stg.     Stephens said he had no specific list of changes. But among his chief concerns was the weakened condition of lesser developed countries and their ability to pay for their imports.     The agency will have to review its policies on insuring export credits to lesser credits on a country by country basis, he said. "Large lump political risk insurance is the sort of thing we want to take a look at."     "You have to try to look forward to see if you are simply in a peak and trough situation or it is a more long term thing," Stephens said, in response to a qustion about whether ECGD will strike more countries from its list of political risk insurance recipients.     He noted that certain countries have already been removed from the list.  REUTER &#3;
veg-oil	OILS/FATS STOCKS SEEN FALLING SHARPLY IN 1986/87 .  Visible stocks of 17 oils and fats are probably peaking now and are likely to fall sharply by October 1 this year, the Oil World newsletter said.     Oil World forecast that stocks of oils and fats may be cut to only 9.8 mln tonnes at the end of this season, compared with 10.6 mln a year earlier.     Its survey covered  13 oils -- soy, cotton, groundnut, sun, rape, sesame, corn, olive, coconut, palmkernel, palm, lin and castor  -- and four animal oils and fats -- butter, fish oil, lard and tallow/greases.     Oil World's analysis predicted only a slight production increase of 0.5 mln tonnes in the year to end-September 1987, compared with increases of 3.6 mln and 4.0 mln tonnes in the previous two seasons.     It said world consumption was continuing to rise. Unusually low prices prevailing since early 1986 had stimulated demand for both food and non-food purposes, it said.     World consumption  could increase by a record 2.8 mln tonnes to 71.8 mln tonnes this season and would be even higher if the Indian government did not artificially curb domestic demand.     Oil World said it did not expect the European Community (EC) to introduce a vegetable oils tax, but if such a tax were introduced it would have a negative impact on EC consumption.  Reuter &#3;
coffee	COLOMBIA TRADERS SAY NEW COFFEE STRATEGY VITAL .  Coffee producing countries must quickly map out a fresh common strategy following the failure of the International Coffee Organization, ICO, to reach agreement on export quotas, Gilberto Arango, president of Colombia's private coffee exporters' association, said.     Arango told Reuters that the most intelligent thing now would be to seek a unifying stand from producers, including Brazil, in order to map out a strategy to defend prices.     An ICO special meeting ended last night in London with exporting and consuming nations failing to agree on a resumption of export quotas, suspended one year ago after prices soared following a prolonged drought in Brazil.     Arango said there would be no imminent catastrophe but predicted that over the short term prices would undoubtedly plummet.     However, he said the market should also take into account evident factors such as Brazil's low stocks and the sale of the near totality of the Central American crop.     Trade sources said Colombia's coffee was today quoted at 1.14 dlrs a lb in New York, its second lowest price in the past 10 years.     Cardenas said these countries apparently fail to understand the true impact of such a failure for coffee producing nations as well as for industrialized countries.     It is difficult to believe that while efforts are made to solve the problem of the developing world's external debt, decisions are being taken which cut earnings used for repaying those debts, he said.     "In Colombia's case, we watch with consternation that, while we try to effectively combat drug trafficking, countries which support us in this fight seek to cut our jugular vein," Cardenas said.

Tender Loving Care said the extended merger agreement continues to provide for the exchange of 1.6 of its shares for each Staff Builders share outstanding.     As announced February 26, the Staff Builders shareholders meeting to vote on the merger, originally convened and adjourned December 23, will be reconvened on April 22.     Tender Loving Care said its payment to Norrell will include 1,950,000 dlrs in cash and five mln dlrs of a new series of eight pct Tender Loving Care convertible preferred.     Tender Loving Care said it and Staff Builders have filed a revised registration and proxy statement with the Securities and Exchange Commission. Upon clearance of the revised proxy statement by the commission and its distribution to Staff Builders' shareholders, that company's management will continue to solicit proxies for approval of the merger.     Tender Loving Care said it will have the power to vote about 15.8 pct of Staff Builders' shares at the adjourned meeting with a spokesman explaining that this represents the proxies held by Norrell, which started buying the stock after the record date for the meeting.     In addition, Staff Builders officers and directors own about 13.8 pct of its stock and have agreed to vote in favor of the merger.

meal-feed,soy-meal,grain,corn	SOVIET SOYMEAL IMPORTS SEEN RISING IN 1987 .  Soviet imports of soymeal may reach or exceed one mln tonnes between January and September this year, the Oil World newsletter said.     Oil World said it was likely the Soviet Union would reduce soybean imports and step up significantly its imports of meal.     At least 500,000 tonnes of soymeal may be shipped from the European Community and South America in the January/March quarter, with additional large quantities likely to be imported in the April and July quarters from Argentina and Brazil, it said. No figures were given for imports in the corresponding periods of 1986.     The change made sense in view of the recent purchases of probably 250,000 tonnes of West European and Polish rapeseed and large scale butter imports that were expected from March onward, it said.     Oil World said substantial losses of Soviet winter grain area due to recent severe frosts were probably behind the recent pick-up in Soviet purchases of U.S. Corn.     It noted that an additional one mln tonnes of U.S. Corn had been bought recently by the Soviet Union.  Reuter &#3;

House Ways and Means Committee Chairman Dan Rostenkowski said he would be reluctant to back the tax increase if it did not have President Reagan's support.     He told a National Press Club luncheon there would be a number of tax proposals that could be debated if Reagan sought a tax increase to help balance the budget.     However, he said he would prefer to leave the tax rates enacted in last year's tax reform bill unchanged.     There have been calls in Congress to hold the rates at the 1987 level rather than allow them to fall next year.     Reagan proposed 22 billion dlrs in revenue as part of his 1988 budget proposal, but it did not include general tax increases.     On trade issues, Rostenkowski said he did not expect the major trade bill this year would single out any U.S. industry for special protection.     "To go after individual items in a trade bill is suicide," he said.     This apparently ruled out congressional approval of another textile trade bill to limit quotas on textile imports, as was proposed again this year.  Reuter &#3;

coffee	PERU COFFEE CROP UNAFFECTED BY RAINS .  Recent heavy rains have not affected the Peru coffee crop and producers are looking forward to a record harvest, the president of one of Peru's four coffee cooperative groups said.     Justo Marin Ludena, president of the Cafe Peru group of cooperatives which accounts for about 20 pct of Peru's exports, told Reuters a harvest of up to 1,800,000 quintales (46 kilos) was expected this year. He said Peru exported 1,616,101 quintales in the year to September 1986.     A spokesman for the Villa Rica cooperative said flood waters last month had not reached coffee plantations, and the crop was unaffected.     Floods in early February caused extensive damage in Villa Rica, whose coffee cooperative exported 59,960 quintales last year, according to the state-controlled coffee organisation.     Marin said the rains would only affect the coffee crop if they continued through to next month, when harvesting starts.     He said Peruvian producers were hoping for an increase this year in the 1.3 pct export quota, about 913,000 quintales, assigned to them by the International Coffee Organisation, ICO.     He said Peru exported 1,381,009 quintales to ICO members last year with a value of around 230 mln dlrs, and another 235,092 quintales, valued at around 35 mln dlrs, to non-ICO members.  Reuter &#3;

earn	GE &lt;GE> PROFIT OUTLOOK AIDED BY ENGINE ORDER .  One of General Electric Co's biggest businesses, aircraft engines, will ride a wave of increasing profits into 1991 because of a new contract worth 650 mln dlrs, Wall Street analysts said.     Previously, it was expected the business would peak and decline at some point in the next five years. The improved outlook results from AMR Corp's &lt;AMR> decision to order 40 new planes powered by CF6-80C2 GE engines.     "Creative financial footwork helped GE get the order," said Nicholas Heymann, analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc.     AMR declined to go into detail on financing arrangements for its order of 15 Boeing Co &lt;BA> and 25 &lt;Airbus Industrie> twinjet long distance aircraft.     But AMR said it was using "rent-a-plane leases" that allow it to operate the aircraft without adding to its debt structure. AMR also has the right to decline delivery of the planes or return them on short notice. The arrangement protects AMR in the case of an unexpected development such as a severe downturn in the economy.     From GE's point of view the package looks like a good deal for several reasons, Heymann said.     GE will be able to record revenue as a sale at the time of delivery, Heymann noted.     And if for some reason AMR decides not to take the planes GE's financial arm, General Electric Financial Services Inc, would have little trouble rounding up another airline that wanted the fuel efficient planes. On the whole, the deal appears to pose little risk for GE, Heymann said.     GE's stock declined 1/4 to 103-1/2 on 625,000 shares by midafternoon. H.P. Smith, analyst at Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co said for a 40 billion dlr (revenue) company "no one order will have much of an effect on the stock."     Russell Leavitt, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc, said the order "will help to maintain a good level of production and profitability in the aircraft engine business" for GE.     Heymann sees operating profits from GE's jet engine business rising from 870 mln dlrs last year to 1.3 billion dlrs by 1991.     Revenue from jet engines was close to six billion dlrs last year, with well over half of the business in the military sector, according to analysts' estimates.     The rosy outlook for GE's jet engine business coincides with an upbeat performance in other segments.     Heymann expects GE to earn 1.39 dlrs per share in the first quarter of 1987. Saying many will be suprised by the results, he believes GE has shown through its acquisition of RCA Corp that it has a "unique ability" to buy a major business and reshape it, pruning some parts and recombining parts with other elements of its 14 business areas.     Smith sees GE earning 1.35 dlrs per share in the current quarter. He credits good results at RCA, in turn aided by the NBC broadcasting operation, and lower interest rates.     Leavitt sees 1.40 dlrs for the current quarter, in part crediting "significant benefits from the RCA acquisition."  Reuter &#3;

French exporters estimated that around 600,000 tonnes of French soft wheat has been sold to China for delivery in the 1986/87 (July/June) year.     Around 300,000 tonnes were exported to China between July 1986 and February this year.     Another 100,000 to 150,000 tonnes will be shipped during this month and around the same amount in April, they said.     France sold around 250,000 tonnes of soft wheat to China in 1985/86, according to customs figures.     However, certain exporters fear China may renounce part of its contract with France after being offered one mln tonnes of U.S. soft wheat under the Export Enhancement Program in January and making some purchases under the initiative.

Alcan Aluminium Ltd said it joined with Carrozzeria Bertone S.P.A. to exhibit Alcan's technology in aluminum structured vehicles at Geneva's international auto salon.     Alcan said it and Bertone have built several Bertone X1/9 sports cars with structures of adhesively bonded sheet aluminum. It said the bodies were made on presses used for Bertone's steel-structured sports cars.     Alcan said two of the cars are currently being tested in Britain by the Motor Industry Research Association.      Alcan said it has developed and tested the aluminum structure technology so that it is suitable for modern auto making methods and plants.     Alcan said the technology, which reduces the weight of a car's basic structure by up to 50 pct, can improve handling and performance and reduce fuel consumption for any size car. It said the structures also provide long life without the need for rust protection.     The structure provides the same stiffness and safety as present materials, while continuously bonded seams allow a 65 pct reduction in spot welds, Alcan said.  Reuter &#3;

earn	F.W. WOOLWORTH'S &lt;Z> 1986 PROFITS RISE 21 PCT .  The specialty retailing area continues to pay off for F.W. Woolworth Co, once known only as a five and dime store chain, which said its 1986 income rose 21 pct.     It was the fourth consecutive year of profit increases for the New York-based retailer which was founded over 100 years ago.     Woolworth's 1986 income rose to 214 mln dlrs or 3.25 dlrs per share compared with 1985's profit of 177 mln or 2.75 dlrs per share. Revenues for the year rose to 6.50 billion compared with the prior year's 5.96 billion.     For the fourth quarter, the company reported profits rose 10 pct to 117 mln dlrs or 1.78 dlrs per share compared with 1985 fourth quarter results of 106 mln or 1.64 dlrs per share. Revenues rose to 2.02 billion from 1.85 billion dlrs.     Roy Garofalo, Woolworth vice president, told Reuters that income generated by the company's specialty store operations accounted for 52 pct of the parent company's 1986 profits.     He said the company now has 4,700 specialty stores operating under 30 different names. Woolworth plans to open 650 more specialty stores in 1987. At this time last year, it operated 4,100 specialty stores, Garofalo said.     Garofalo said the largest specialty chain operated by Woolworth is Kinney Shoe Stores, followed by the Richman apparel unit. Among other units are Little Folk Shop, a chain of discount children's apparel stores; The Rx Place, a discount drug, health and beauty aid operation; and Face Fantasies, which sells cosmetics. There are currently about 1,700 Woolworth general merchandise stores operating worldwide, of which 1,200 are in the United States.     Harold Sells, chairman and chief executive of Woolworth, said in a statement, "These results are especially gratifying as they are an improvement over last year's record earnings."     Sells that it was the fourth successive year earnings in each quarter improved over the corresponding year-earlier period.     Woolworth's variety store operations were hard hit in the 1970's and early 1980's by the quickly growing discount store industry. In an attempt to compete in the 1970's, Woolworth opened a discount general store chain, Woolco, and J. Brannam, a discount apparel chain. Both were failures in the United States, although Woolco still operates in Canada.     In 1985, however, Woolworth changed its strategy and announced that it would operate specialty stores. At that time, the company said it would create 14 new groups of such stores. Specialty stores generally have higher sales per square foot than general merchandise stores.      Reuter &#3;

gnp	CANADA ECONOMY EXPECTED TO GROW MODERATELY .  Canadian economic growth is expected to slow further in 1987, but an improved the trade picture should keep the country from recession, economists said.     "The economy is ready for about a 2.0 pct rate of growth over the course of 1987," said Carl Beigie, Chief Economist at Dominion Securities Pitfield Ltd.     Statistics Canada reported that gross domestic product, grew 3.1 pct in 1986, the fourth year of continuous expansion, but down from 1985's four pct.     In the final quarter, GDP, in 1981 prices and at annualized rates, rose a slight 0.2 pct after expanding 0.8 pct in the third quarter.     "Essentially it is a flat performance," said Warren Jestin, deputy chief economist at the Bank of Nova Scotia.     Economist Wendy Smith Cork of the brokerage Nesbitt Thomson Bongard Inc said "it shows the economy is not moving along very steadily, it's not a very promising number."     "We weren't surprised, we expected to see one bad quarter in Canada, but we don't think there will be a recession," she added.     The rise in GDP was below the 3.3 pct increase forecast by Federal Finance Minister Michael Wilson in his budget last month. He also projected the economy would expand  2.8 pct this year.     Many economists are less optimistic, predicting growth will likely be in the 2.0 to 2.2 pct range.     Statistics Canada also reported the country's trade performance deteriorated sharply last year as the deficit in the current account rose to a record 8.8 billion Canadian dlrs from the previous year's shortfall of 584 mln dlrs.     "The sharp increase in the deficit originated from merchandise trade transactions where imports continued to advance strongly whereas exports were virtually unchanged," the federal agency said in a statement.     The merchandise trade surplus was pared to 10.13 billion dlrs in 1986 from 17.48 billion dlrs in 1985.     But economist Cork said the expected upturn in the U.S. economy will lead to increased demand for Canadian goods, and help fuel the country's modest expansion. Nearly 80 pct of Canada's exports are shipped to the U.S. each year.  Reuter &#3;

In a speech to a meeting of south Florida business executives, Goodyear Chairman Robert Mercer lashed out at corporate raiders and takeover specialists, accusing them of causing serious harm to the companies they target.   "Their interest is not in preserving and strengthening America's industrial and providing jobs," he said. "Their product is simply deals, and that is not a product which a country ... can base a future on."     Last year, Mercer fought off a takeover attempt by British industrialist Sir James Goldsmith.     But Goodyear's independence was preserved at a high price, Mercer said.     The company bought back Goldsmith's stock for 620 mln dlrs, giving him a 93 mln dlr profit. Goodyear also paid him 37 mln dlrs for expenses and bought about 41 mln other shares for over two billion dlrs.     In an effort to trim its new debt, Goodyear closed down three plants Mercer believes otherwise could have been saved, sold its motor wheel and aerospace units and reduced its payroll by 10 pct, he said.

grain	SOVIET GRAINS SEEN ENTERING SPRING ON SHAKY NOTE .  Soviet winter grains could be off to a faulty start this spring after enduring an usually dry fall and cold winter, weather and crop analysts said.     Prospects for another near-record grain harvest in the Soviet Union appear dim at this point, but it is premature to forecast any major crop problems, analysts said.     But the situation bears careful watching over the next six weeks and will ultimately impact the Soviet grain supply and future buying plans, analysts of the Soviet Union said.     "From a weather standpoint, you can say with certainty that the Soviets are not getting off to a good start and will have a lower crop (than last year)," Gail Martell, chief meteorologist for E.F. Hutton said.     The next six weeks in the USSR's grain growing areas will be the crucial period that will determine the final outcome of the winter crops, Martell and other analysts said.     "Where the crop is really made or broken is still ahead of us," an Agriculture Department authority on the USSR said.     The Soviet Union recently reported that nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded due to winterkill. This would be equal to about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in ten years, the USDA analyst said.     With a timely spring, Soviet farmers would probably be able to reseed the damaged acreage with spring crops, but analysts noted that spring crops normally yield lower than winter crops -- sometimes as much as 30-35 pct lower.     Normally winterkill is caused by inadequate snowcover combined with cold temperatures. This winter, however, snowcover in Soviet grain areas has generally been excellent, so the bulk of winterkill, analysts speculate, likely has been due to a very dry fall and subsequent poor crop germination.     "Fall dryness may be a problem. There's a good correlation between mediocre crops and fall dryness," Martell said.     Precipitation last fall was as little as 25 pct of normal in southern and northern Ukraine, and below normal over the entire winter crop area, she said.     Recent cold temperatures in grain areas in which the snowcover has been gradually melting could also have caused  problems of ice-crusting and winterkill, Jim Candor, senior forecaster for Accu Weather, said.     Livestock feed needs have probably increased because of the fall and winter, analysts said. The dry fall damaged pastures, the cold winter raised feed demands and a late spring would require longer off-pasture feeding, they said.     "The Soviets are not in a desperate situation ... they don't have to buy (grains) now," a USDA official said.     But if the Soviets are worried about their winter crops and if they feel that last year's huge crop of 210 mln tonnes was a one-time fluke brought on by perfect conditions, more Soviet buying might occur to insure crop supplies, he said.     Bad weather during the next six weeks could push the Soviets back into the market, weather analysts said.     "A lot of winterkill could occur during the next month and a half," Martell said.

crude	OIL PRICES RISE ON SAUDI EFFORT .  Crude oil prices rallied today, moving over 17.00 dlrs a barrel because of Saudi Arabia's determined effort to support prices, analysts said.     "The Saudis and other OPEC nations are jawboning the market, hoping to restore confidence and prices and to do this without another meeting," said Sanford Margoshes, oil analyst with Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc.     "But OPEC is not out of the woods yet by a longshot due to seasonal declines in demand and some cheating," he added.     Oil industry analysts said Saudi Arabia has led the attempt to get other OPEC members to resist pressures to discount from the official prices agreed to last december.     The analysts said that to get others to hold the line, Saudi Arabia pushed hard at the meeting of deputy oil ministers of the Gulf Cooperation Council last weekend and at the Cooperation Council oil ministers' meeting the previous week.     The Saudis have also offered to support members having difficulty in selling their oil, analysts said.     "They are trying to make sure that no one discounts, and to prevent that, it appears that Saudi Arabia or some other OPEC member will allocate some of their oil sales to help members that lose sales," Margoshes said.     He added that the allocations would probably be in the form of loans to be repaid when these nations resume sales.     Analysts said this would be useful in keeping in line nations like Qatar, which has had trouble selling oil. But it is also likely that such assistance would be provided to Nigeria which is under pressure to extend discounts.     Analysts said that Saudi Arabia, with assistance from OPEC president Rilwanu Lukman, was trying to avoid an emergency OPEC meeting for fear that it would give the appearance that the December pact is falling apart.     Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Upham Harris and Co said, "both physical and futures markets have been oversold and it only took a small spark to bring on a short covering rally."     He believes an Iranian trade mission to Tokyo, which refused discounts to Japanese buyers, brought Japanese refiners into the market to cover their short positions.     Oil traders said one japanese refiner came into the market to but 10 cargoes of May Dubai, which sent prices up on Mideast sours, with Dubai trading up to 16.50 dlrs after trading yeterray as low as 15.63 dlrs and then spilled over into the North sea crude oil market.     Traders said that there have been persistent rumors today that Japanese buyers are looking to pick up cargoes of Brent for Japan and European trade sources indidate rumors of vessels being fixed to make such shipments.     North sea brent today rose over 17.00 dlrs with trades reported as high as 17.05 dlrs, up one dlr.     OPEC members' denials that they are producing over their quotas sparked moves to cover short postitions.     Indonesian oil minister Subroto said today that OPEC production was below the 15.8 mln bpd quota agreed to last december but he gave no details on OPEC production against claims it was more at least one mln bpd above that level.     "The production probably is about their quota level and largely because Saudi Arabia will not discount and canot sell its oil as a result," Margoshes said.     Analysts have mixed opinions about the extent of the current rally. Some believe prices can continue to rise if Saudi Arabia and OPEC hold steady in a refusal to discount.     But others said that despite the rally today there were still several fundamental factors, including demand, which could cut the rally short.     Marion Stewart, an indepedent petroleum economist, said slow growth in the economies of the U.S. and OECD would keep demand for oil slack and he now estimates that demand to rise about 1.4 pct over 1986.

coffee	COFFEE MAY FALL MORE BEFORE NEW QUOTA TALKS .  Coffee prices may have to fall even lower to bring exporting and importing countries once more round the negotiating table to discuss export quotas, ICO delegates and traders said.     The failure last night of International Coffee Organization, ICO, producing and consuming countries to agree export quotas brought a sharp fall on international coffee futures markets today with the London May price reaching a 4-1/2 year low at one stage of 1,270 stg per tonne before ending the day at 1,314 stg, down 184 stg from the previous close.     The New York May price was down 15.59 at 108.00 cents a lb.     Pressure will now build up on producers returning from the ICO talks to sell coffee which had been held back in the hope the negotiations would establish quotas which would put a floor under prices, some senior traders said.     The ICO 15 day average price stood at 114.66 cents a lb for March 2. This compares with a target range of 120 to 140 cents a lb under the system operating before quotas were suspended in February last year following a sharp rise in international prices caused by drought damage to the Brazilian crop.     In a Reuter interview, Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, President Jorio Dauster urged producers not to panic and said they need to make hard commercial decisions. "If we have failed at the ICO, at least we have tried," Dauster said, adding "now it is time to go and sell coffee."     But Brazil is keeping its marketing options open. It plans to make an official estimate of the forthcoming crop next month, Dauster said. It is too difficult to forecast now. Trade sources have put the crop at over 26 mln bags compared with a previous crop of 11.2 mln. Brazil is defining details of public selling tenders for coffee bought on London's futures market last year.     A basic condition will be that it does not go back to the market "in one go" but is sold over a minimum of six months.     The breakdown of the ICO negotiations reflected a split between producers and consumers on how to set the yardstick for future quotas. Consumers said "objective criteria" like average exports and stocks should determine producer quota shares, Dauster said.     All elements of this proposal were open to negotiation but consumers insisted they did not want a return to the "ad hoc" way of settling export quotas by virtual horse trading amongst producers whilst consumers waited in the corridors of the ICO.     Dauster said stocks and exports to ICO members and non-members all need to be considered when setting quotas and that Brazil would like to apply the coffee pact with a set ratio of overall quota reflecting stock holdings.     It is a "simplistic misconception that Brazil can dictate" policy to other producers. While consumer countries are welcome to participate they cannot dictate quotas which are very difficult to allocate as different "objective criteria" achieve different share-outs of quota, Dauster said.     Other delegates said there was more open talking at the ICO and at least differences were not hidden by a bad compromise.     Consumer delegates said they had not been prepared to accept the producers' offer to abandon quotas if it proves impossible to find an acceptable basis for them.     "We want the basis of quotas to reflect availability and to encourage stock holding as an alternative to a buffer stock if supplies are needed at a later stage," one delegate said.     Some consumers claimed producer support for the consumer argument was gaining momentum towards the end of the ICO session but said it is uncertain whether this will now collapse and how much producers will sink their differences should prices fall further and remain depressed.     The ICO executive board meets here March 30 to April 1 but both producer and consumer delegates said they doubt if real negotiations will begin then. The board is due to meet in Indonesia in June with a full council scheduled for September.     More cynical traders said the pressure of market forces and politics in debt heavy Latin American producer countries could bring ICO members back around the negotiating table sooner than many imagine. In that case quotas could come into force during the summer. But most delegates and traders said quotas before October are unlikely, while Brazil's Dauster noted the ICO has continued although there were no quotas from 1972 to 1980.     A clear difference between the pressures already being felt by importers and exporters was that consumers would have been happy to agree on a formula for future quotas even if it could not be imposed now. At least in that way they said they could show a direct relationship between quotas and availability.     In contrast producers wanted stop-gap quotas to plug the seemingly bottomless market and were prepared to allow these to lapse should lasting agreement not be found.     "Producers were offering us jam tomorrow but after their failure to discuss them last year promises were insufficient and we wanted a cast iron commitment now," one consumer said.  Reuter &#3;

The measure, sponsored by committee Chairman Patrick Leahy (D-Vt.) and Sen.

The trade missions would seek to generate interest in the U.S. government's food donation and commercial programs -- PL480, Section 416, export credit and export enhancement -- and upon return be required to advocate extension of concessional or commercial benefits to interested countries.     The trade teams would be made up of representatives of the U.S. Agriculture Department, State Department, the Agency for International Development and private voluntary organizations such as U.S. Wheat Associates.     The bill would require teams within six months to visit seven countries: Mexico, Philippines, Indonesia, India, Bangladesh, Senegal and Nigeria.

Total supply of frozen concentrated orange juice (FCOJ) in 1986/87 is expected to be significantly above year-earlier levels, even with carry-in stocks well below the previous season, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     In a summary of its Fruit Situation Report, the Department said Florida's imports of FCOJ, mostly from Brazil, have shown sharp gains to date.     The Department noted the price of FCOJ will probably be affected by the final decision, scheduled for April 22, on whether the U.S. considers Brazilian FCOJ exports to the U.S. have caused injury.     Continuing strong demand for fresh and processing fruit coupled with seasonal declines in supplies mean that grower prices will remain higher this spring than a year earlier.     The department said stocks of fresh apples in cold storage at the beginning of February were moderately larger than a year earlier, but strong demand has kept apple prices firm.     In view of the strong demand and seasonally reduced supplies, apple prices are projected to stay firm.     During the remainder of 1986/87, supplies of most processed noncitrus fruit will be smaller than a year ago, it said.     Movement of canned fruit has improved, and remaining suppies for some canned fruit items are tight and as a consequence prices have strengthened, the department said.  Reuter &#3;

grain,corn,sorghum	U.S. CORN, SORGHUM PAYMENTS 50-50 CASH/CERTS .  Eligible producers of 1986 crop U.S. corn and sorghum will receive an estimated 600 mln dlrs in deficiency payments -- 50 pct in generic commodity certificates and 50 pct in cash, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     It said corn producers will receive about 515 mln dlrs and sorghum producers about 85 mln dlrs.     Only the cash portion of the payments will be subject to the 4.3 pct reduction in compliance with the Gramm-Rudman budget deficit control act of 1985, it said.     Corn and sorghum producers who requested advance deficiency payments have already received about 2.8 billion dlrs and 225 mln dlrs, respectively, USDA said.     The Department said deficiency payment rates of 51.5 cents per bushel for corn and 49 cents per bushel for sorghum were received by producers requesting advance payments.     Deficiency payments are calculated as the difference between an established target price and the higher of the basic loan rate, or the national average price received by farmers during the first five months of the marketing year -- September-January.     National weighted average market prices for the first five months of the season were 1.46 dlrs per bushel for corn and 1.33 dlrs per bushel for sorghum. Eligible corn producers will be paid 63 cts per bushel, based on the difference between the 3.03 target price and the 2.40 dlr per bushel basic loan rate.     Sorghum producers' deficiency payment rate will be 60 cents per bushel, based on the difference between the 2.88 dlrs per bushel target price and the 2.28 dlrs per bushel basic loan rate.     The deficiency payment rates for both commodities are the maximum permitted by law, the department said.     Eligible corn and sorghum producers will receive another 1986 crop deficiency payment in October if the national average market prices received by farmers during the entire marketing year for both commodities are below the basic loan rates, the department said.     The payments will be issued through local Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service offices, it said.  Reuter &#3;

Under current rules, the "good" grade of meat has less marbling and fat than the "prime" or "choice" grades, it said.     Standards for all of the grades would remain unchanged under the proposal.

grain,wheat	AUSTRALIAN GOVERNMENT TO PAY SUBSIDIES--USDA .  The Australian Government will likely reimburse the Australian Wheat Board, AWB, about 132 mln (U.S.) dlrs to pay wheat farmers for their 1986/87 crop, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the department said the sharp fall in world wheat prices has reduced the export sales revenue of the AWB to levels insufficient to cover its breakeven export price estimated at around 98 dlrs per tonne.      For example the recent large sales of wheat to China (1.5 mln tonnes) and Egypt (2.0 mln tonnes) were well below the breakeven export price, it said.     Australian wheat farmers normally receive an advance payment known as the Guaranteed Minimum Price, GMP, calculated at 90 pct of the average of estimated returns in the current year and the two lowest of the previous three years, the department said.     In addition, deductions for taxes, freight, handling and storage are deducted from the GMP the farmer receives.     But the department said the Australian Bureau of Agricultural Economics, BAE, predicts wheat production will drop sharply from 17.8 mln tonnes in 1986/87 to 13.5 mln in 1989/90.     The decline will result from low world grain prices leading to shifts to livestock and other crops which could benefit U.S. wheat exports, the department said.  Reuter &#3;

Japanese traders have apparently sharply reduced commitments to buy Chinese corn over the next six months due to high prices, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     In its World Production and Trade Report, the department said traders indicated China may lack supplies or be unwilling to sell at current low world prices.     If the reports are confirmed, China's major export destinations such as USSR, Japan, and South Korea, could increase purchases of U.S. corn, it said.

crude	SAUDI SUCCESS SEEN IN CURBING OPEC PRODUCTION .  Saudi Arabia will succeed in pressuring other members of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries to stay within their production quotas, said Morgan Stanley Group managing director John Wellemeyer.     Wellemeyer, speaking to reporters at an offshore oil engineering conference, also said he expected OPEC nations to attempt to hold prices under 20 dlrs a barrel for several years to keep industrial demand for residual fuel oil strong.     "Over the next few weeks I think you'll see a concerted effort by the Saudis to get production down," Wellemeyer said.     "The Saudis are committed to that price level (of 18 dlrs a barrel) and are willing to make it happen again," he said.     In recent weeks, oil prices fell to the 16 to 17 dlrs a barrel level on market reports of some OPE members producing above their quota, pushing total OPEC production to 15.8 mln barrels per day. But prices rebounded today, with April U.S. crude prices up about one dlr to over 17 dlrs a barrel on a belief Saudi Arabia is attempting to curb OPEC output.     Wellemeyer said that sharp declines in U.S. oil production could push demand for OPEC oil above 20 mln barrels per day as early as 1989 and up to 24 mln barrels per day by 1993.     Although the projected increases in demand for OPEC oil should strengthen world prices, Wellemeyer said he believed the organization would hold its official price below 20 dlrs a barrel for some time to prevent residual fuel users from switching to natural gas supplies. The interfuel swing market accounts for about eight mln barrels a day, or 18 pct of the world demand for oil.  Reuter &#3;
grain,wheat	EC DRIVING TO CAPTURE BRAZIL WHEAT MARKET - USDA .  The European Community, EC, sold 75,000 tonnes of soft wheat at a subsidized price of between 85 and 89 dlrs per tonne FOB for March delivery in a continuing bid to establish itself in the Brazilian wheat market, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     The sale sharply undercut the U.S. offer of 112 dlrs per tonne FOB for 33,000 tonnes of wheat, it said in its latest report on Export Markets for U.S grains.     EC sales to Brazil total about 225,000 tonnes during 1986/87 (July-June) in stark contrast to only 50,000 tonnes in the 1985/86 season, it said.     The increasing presence of EC wheat in Brazil comes at a time when the Brazilian Wheat Board, BWB, expects the wheat import market will expand to 3.4 mln tonnes from the current forecast of 3.0 mln in the 1986/87 year.     The BWB cites record consumption and an eventual decline in domestic production, and says government plans to lower the guaranteed price of wheat from 242 dlrs per tonne to 180 dlrs will contribute to greater import demand, the USDA said.     It said the BWB expects the U.S. to be major supplier of the additional 400,000 tonnes, but commitments for purchase of U.S. wheat through two-thirds of 1986/87 year total only 600,000 tonnes versus 700,000 a year ago.

grain,corn	SOUTH AFRICA CORN EXPORTS COULD BE REDUCED-USDA .  Despite earlier optimistic indications, the South African corn crop is at a critical stage in its development and recent reports of heat stress could reduce production and therefore exportable supplies, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     In its report on Export Markets for U.S. Grains, the department said South Africa's corn exports in the 1986/87 (Oct-Sept) season are estimated at 2.5 mln tonnes, up 40 pct from the previous year.     The re-emergence of South Africa as a competitor follows a period of severe droughts, which at one point required South Africa to import 2.7 mln tones of U.S. corn in 1983/84, it said.     Since those imports in 1983/84, the U.S. has been facing increased competition from South Africa in Taiwan and Japan.     But if South Africa is perceived as lacking available supplies, purchases of U.S. corn may be further stimulated, the department said.  Reuter &#3;

grain,cotton,wheat,oat,oilseed,soybean	CBT TRADERS LOOK AHEAD TO SPRING PLANTINGS .  Chicago Board of trade grain traders and analysts voiced a lot of interest in how farmers planned to handle their upcoming spring plantings, prompting sales of new crop months of corn and oats and purchases in new crop soybeans in the futures markets.     Professionals in the grains trade think that farmers will be more willing to stick with corn acres than soybeans because corn is protected by the acreage reduction program. That gives deficiency payments to farmers if corn prices stay low.     Farmers can place soybeans under the loan program if they sign-up for reduced acreage, but they have no price guarantees.     With the price outlook for both commodities so dismal, traders believe farmers will want to stick with a sure thing rather than gamble on soybeans, even though the new crop soybean/corn ratio of 2.9/1 would make planting soybeans more attractive under normal circumstances.     An announcement late Friday that the USDA will lift the limited cross-compliance requirement for the 1987 oats crop, means farmers will be able plant an estimated two to three mln more oat acres this year than last without being penalized, traders said.     Here too, acres some farmers may have been thinking of shifting to soybeans will now be planted with oats, due to the more attractive deal from the government, they added.     Cotton prices are almost twice what they were just six months ago, which should prompt many farmers in the South to put soybean land back into cotton.     One of the reasons for the steady increase in soybean production in recent years has been a general shift of acres in traditional cotton producing regions of the South to soybeans, which are easier to grow, one commercial trader said.

The Senate Agriculture Committee is expected to take up a bill tomorrow that would exempt from government conservation regulations those farmers who have rotated alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes with row crops, committee staff said.     Under current so-called "sodbuster" law, farmers who planted alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes on highly erodible land in the years 1981 through 1985 lose federal farm program benefits if they produce a row crop on that land in later years.     Sen. Edward Zorinsky (D-Neb.), sponsor of the measure, said recently that those crop rotating practices resulted in less erosion than the practices of many farmers who produced strictly row crops.

Rockwell reported net earnings in its first quarter ended December 31 of 149.4 mln dlrs, or 1.05 dlrs per share, compared to 125.8 mln dlrs, or 84 cts per share a year ago.     Operating earnings, however, were off about four pct, and analysts have attributed the decline to Rockwell's Allen-Bradley unit, which has suffered from weakness in the industrial automation market.     "It is in a soft market now, but we are not concerned. It is moving forward with market development and is enhancing market share," Beall said of Allen-Bradley unit.     Beall, who was in Los Angeles to address a Technology management conference, said first quarter sales for the Allen-Bradley unit were flat as compared to a year earlier. He said the company does not break out operating earnings by unit on a quarterly basis.     Beall said the recent trend toward cost sharing in the research and development phase of government contracts should not have a major impact on Rockwell's near-term performance.     He noted, however, the increasing focus on cost sharing could limit technological innovation.     "I worry that we are heading into a period of misuse of contracting approaches too early in the development stages of important military contracts," Beall said, adding, "long-term, we have a very serious problem."

money-fx,interest	SWAP DEALERS UNVEIL STANDARD CONTRACT .  The International Swap Dealers Association has developed the first standard form contract for use by arrangers of currency and interest rate swap transactions, said Thomas Jasper, the Association's co-chairman.     The contract, unveiled at a press conference , is expected to make the 300 billion dlr a year swap market more efficient, he said. "The contracts wil accelerate the process and reduce the expense of swap documentation," Japsper said.     Privately, eurobond traders estimate that about 80 pct of all new issues eventually become part of either an interest rate or currency swap.     An interest rate swap occurs when two issuers, usually acting through a bank middleman, agree to accept each other's interest payments on debt securities. Usually, the issuer of a floating rate debt security swaps into fixed-rate debt and vice versa. But the obligation for repayment of the debt remains with the original borrower.     Bank regulators have become concerned about the use of swaps because the middleman, usually a bank, takes on some portion of the risk but is not required to show it on the balance sheet as a liability and may not have sufficient capital to cushion it.     Kenneth McCormick, a co-chairman of the ISDA and president of Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said the Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board were expected later today to announce joint proposals for setting minimum capital standards for counterparties in swaps.     The standards are part of the recently announced convergence agreement between the two countries in which regulators have attempted to set similar capital requirements for institutions.     McCormick told reporters the ISDA was concerned that a "level playing field" be maintained in the swaps market.     He said if U.K. And U.S. Banks were required to hold more primary capital against swap transactions than is the current practice, the additional costs would have to be passed on to issuers.     The issuers might then choose to do business with lower-cost banks which are not subject to U.S. Or U.K. Banking rules.     He said the ISDA had been working on a code of conduct for swap dealers as part of its self-regulatory effort.     That code should be completed within the next few weeks, he said.  REUTER &#3;

It earlier reported 1986 losses before extraordinary items rose to 26.4 mln dlrs from year-ago 7.2 mln dlrs.     B.C. Resources also said dividends on its series 2 preferred shares and exchangeable preferred shares will remain suspended.     However, payment will be made on account of the quarterly dividend on the exchangeable preferred shares by the company's trustee from a deposit account, B.C. Resources said.     Sufficient funds should be available to pay full amount of the March 31, 1987 dividend to exchangeable preferred shareholders, with payment expected in early April to shareholders of record March 31, the company said.     If future dividends are not declared after the April exchangeable preferred quarterly payout, future payment will depend on the amount of dividends received from Westcoast Transmission Co &lt;WTC>, B.C. Resources said.     The company said its increased fourth quarter and full year operating losses primarily resulted from lower oil prices and a four month labor shutdown at its Balmer coal mine in British Columbia.     B.C. Resources also recorded a 99.9 mln dlr extraordinary loss, which included losses on disposition of North Sea oil and gas interests by 67 pct owned &lt;Westar Mining Ltd>.     B.C. Resources' 1986 extraordinary charge also included a writedown of its investment in Westar Petroleum. Gains on the sales of Westar Timber's Skeena and Celgar pulp mills and Terrace sawmill partially offset the extraordinary loss, the company said.     The company said the asset sales have eliminated B.C. Resources' long term financing commitment in the North Sea and exposure to the fluctuating pulp market.     It also said it cut long term debt in 1986 to 900 mln dlrs from 1.3 billion dlrs at year-end 1985, and management changes and staff cuts have significantly reduced costs.  Reuter &#3;

The loss in the quarter was 232.3 mln dlrs or 6.75 dlrs against income of 10.7 mln dlrs or 31 cts a year ago. Revenues in the quarter fell to 521.1 mln dlrs from 716.9 mln and in the year fell to 1.9 billion dlrs from 2.5 billion in 1985.     Williams also said the previously announced sale of its Agrico Chemical Co unit to Freeport-Mcmoran Resource Partners Ltd has cleared antitrust review and should close next week.     The 1987 first quarter will include proceeds from the Agrico sale, for 250 mln dlrs cash at closing plus deferred payments, and proceeds of 320 mln dlrs from the sale of a stake in Peabody Holding Co, completed in January.     In the 1986 first quarter, Williams reported net of 14.2 mln dlrs or 41 cts a share on sales of 796.4 mln dlrs.     Williams said the charges in the current year were related to an ongoing restructuring. The company said the restructuring moves had improved its balance sheet and improved the outlook for future stability and growth in earnings.     Operating profit at the company's Northwest Pipeline Corp unit fell 4.5 pct to 150 mln dlrs from lower sales. The Williams Natural Gas unit had operating profit of 50.5 mln dlrs compared to 90.9 mln dlrs on lower sales volumes.

acq	SENATE'S PROXMIRE URGES CURBS ON TAKEOVERS .  Senate Banking Committee chairman William Proxmire called for curbs of hostile corporate takeovers and new restrictions on risk arbitrageurs.     "At the very least, it is high time that we require all risk arbitrageurs to register seperately and specifically  with the Securities and Exchange Commission and that we consider precluding brokerage firms and their employers from investing in, or owning any securities issued by, third party risk arbitrage operations," Proxmire said at the start of a hearing on corporate takeovers.     "A burning issue must be whether there ought to be a complete seperation in the future of risk arbitrage and investment banking," Proxmire said.     He said he was concerned that hostile takeover attempts were hurting the economy, a view shared by corporate executives who tesitified at the hearing. "I believe that takeovers have become so abusive and so tilted in favor of the financial buccaneers that remedial action is required," USX Corp chairman David Roderick said. "For Congress to allow the takeover game to continue unchecked, would be economic suicide," Champion International Corp chairman Andrew Sigler added.  Reuter &#3;
trade	SPAIN TO LAUNCH EXPORT DRIVE .  Spain unveils a 105 billion peseta plan this month aimed at boosting exports to reach European Community levels, director-general of the INFE export institute, Apolonio Ruiz Ligero, said.     "The target is to raise exports to 20 pct of Gross Domestic Product over the next four years compared to 15 pct now," he said.      "This is the minimum prevailing level in the EC and there is no reason why we should lag behind countries like Italy, which have a similar productive structure," he said.     The plan calls for providing soft loans, tax cuts and other fiscal benefits to exporters and raising Spain's presence in international trade fairs.     Consumer goods such as fashion and wine, as well as traditional industrial exports will be promoted.     Ruiz Ligero said INFE would double its annual budget to 20 billion pesetas to finance the four-year plan, while the government's development aid fund (FAD) would provide a special 25 billion peseta grant.     The plan calls for boosting exports by five to six pct in real terms this year after a 7.4 pct decline last year.     Ruiz Ligero attributed this drop to a lack of demand in developing countries and a rally in domestic consumer demand, which rose six pct last year after 1.9 pct in 1985.     He added that 80 pct of Spain's exports went to Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD) countries.     The EC accounts for 60 pct of the market and exports to the Community rose seven pct last year. The government plans to concentrate efforts on Western Europe and the U.S.     "The problem is convincing businessmen that exports are vital to survival in the context of EC competition," he said.     He said Spanish businessmen traditionally turned to the domestic market to satisfy rises in consumer demand, while turning their backs on foreign markets.     "They have to realise their share of the home market is going to shrink with growing deregulation," he said. "Foreign companies are taking up positions in the domestic economy and it is it vital to secure a market share abroad."  REUTER &#3;

The parent bank balance sheet rose 89 mln marks to 13.2 billion, while business volume was almost unchanged at 14.8 billion. Credit volume eased to 9.1 billion from 9.2 billion while loans to companies rose seven pct.     Foreign business and securities trading turnover also increased. Higher earnings from trading on the bank's own account contributed to record operating profits.     Net interest income rose on firmer interest margins by 16.1 mln marks to 381.6 mln. Net commission income rose 6.6 mln to 156.7 mln, Luckey said.     Foreign commercial business was influenced by a fall in West German foreign trade but earnings were still satisfactory.     The bank's exposure in Latin America was less than two pct of its total foreign credit and in Africa less than one pct.

rubber	LEAF DISEASE HITS SRI LANKA RUBBER .  A leaf disease affecting seven pct of Sri Lanka's rubber plantations may reduce output this year and raise currently depressed prices, industry officials and researchers told Reuters.     About 2,900 hectares of rubber planted with the Rubber Research Institute (RRI) clone 103 have been hit by the fungus "corenes pora" which attacks the roots of the tree and kills the leaves. The disease was first discovered about six months ago.     Trade sources say prices might boom once again if the crisis leads to output below the 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes. Last year's output is estimated at between 133,000 and 135,000 tonnes.     Researchers say the fungus could spread to other rubber clones if no immediate action is taken.     "The RRI is considering asking estates to remove the trees seriously affected by the fungus because it was too late to use chemicals to kill the disease," an Institute spokesman said.     Senior industry and research officials met yesterday at Padukka, east of here, to discuss ways of controlling the fungus which is affecting estates mostly belonging to the State Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board.     The two state-owned groups account for 30 pct of rubber land with the balance belonging to small private producers with a total of 145,600 hectares.     The RRIC 103 is a new clone propagated by the Research Institute as high yielding and recommended two years ago for planting. Only the two state groups seriously planted these clones while smallholders preferred the low-yielding but older PBX Malaysian clones.     Officials at yesterday's crisis meeting said it was decided to uproot only some of the affected trees while others would be treated. They declined to comment on other decisions taken.     Trade sources said supplies had improved in the past week but prices had hit their lowest since last December. "If there is a shortage of rubber, prices are bound to rise," a spokesman for a company buying on behalf of the Soviet Union said.     Rubber prices, particularly crepe, fell sharply by about four rupees a kilo between December and March. The best crepe one-X traded at 23.68 rupees a kilo, averaged 19.75 at this week's auction. Sheet prices fell by a rupee in the same period.     Quantities offered at the auction also fell to an average of 300 tonnes per auction last month from 800 tonnes in December because of wintering in early February in producing areas.     Over 550 tonnes were offered at this Tuesday's auction with the supply position showing improvements.     Trade sources said the smaller availability of rubber last month did not raise prices as on previous occasions.     "Some factors, like less storage space from excess stocks, meant we could not buy much at the auction until we disposed of the rubber we already had," one buyer said.     Other sources said there were few forward contracts and speculative buying last month, while delays in steamer arrivals aggravated the problem.     European buyers delayed their purchases because of winter closures of factories and also in the hope that prices would ease further.     They said another problem that could hit the industry is the dry spell in producing areas. "If the inter-monsoonal rains expected in late March/April are delayed, we would have further shortages," one official said.     "But this again could benefit prices," a buyer said.  Reuter &#3;

cpi	GERMAN INSTITUTE SEES INFLATION RISING IN 1987 .  The cost of living in West Germany will likely be about 0.5 pct higher on average in 1987 than in 1986, when the cost of living actually fell by an average 0.2 pct in the first recurrence of "negative inflation" since the 1950s, the HWWA economic research institute said.     The re-emergence of inflation will result mainly from the fading of two factors which influenced the fall in the 1986 cost of living - the steep decline in both oil prices and the value of the dollar, the institute said in a report.     The institute said inflation will see a rising trend in the course of 1987, but will average only 0.5 pct for the year as a whole because year on year rates will remain negative in the first part of 1987.     Provisional inflation figures for February released last week showed the cost of living last month was 0.5 pct lower than in February 1986. In January prices had fallen 0.8 pct against the same month a year earlier.     The HWWA said its forecast assumed the dollar would remain around 1.80 marks and oil prices would range between 15 and 17 dlrs per barrel.  REUTER &#3;
interest,money-fx	FED DRAFTS CURRENCY, RATE SWAP RISK GAUGE .  The Federal Reserve Board voted unanimously to propose a formula for calculating the risk of interest rate and currency swaps as part of its ongoing effort to come up with a new capital standard for U.S. banks that takes into account the riskiness of a bank's loans and other assets.     Fed officials said an identical proposal was being issues today by the Bank of England.     The Fed set a 60-day period for public comment on the plan.     The proposal adopted today addresses only the credit risks associated with interest rate swaps, forward foreign exchange contracts and similar financial instruments.     Previously, the Fed Jan. 8 proposed a series of guidelines for calculating the risk of other off-balance-sheet activities that banks would be required to take into account in calculating the minimum financial cushion they would need to maintain.     Both guidelines set five broad categories of risk for loans and other bank assets and assigned to each a level of risk that would establish a bank's minimum capital needs.     The additional guidelines proposed today would determine the amount of capital support required for a bank's current exposure for a given asset and the potential future exposure.     The current exposure would be measured by the mark-to-market value of the asset, which would reflect the replacement cost.     Potential future increases in the replacement cost would be calculated using credit conversion factors based on statistical analyses by the staffs of the Bank of England and U.S. banking regulators. Future exposure would rise over the life of the asset.     The Fed staff said the risk gauge attempted to balance conflicting needs for precision and simplicity.     They ignore, for example, the relative volatility of the particular currencies involved in exchange rate contracts.     Board officials said the new gauge could increase the capital required of the largest money center banks, which are the principal participants in these types of activities.     They cautioned the Fed board to take account of the potential impact of the plan on the ability of U.S. banks to compete in world financial markets.     However, the staff concluded, "The credit risks inherent in such contracts now constitute a significant element of the risk profiles of some banking organizations."     The Fed proposal would exempt all but the 20-25 largest participants in this market, on grounds the benefits of including the smaller banks would be outweighed by costs.     Also excluded would be interest rate and foreign exchange contracts traded on organized exchanges.     Governor Martha Seger said she was concerned that Japan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capital rules.  Reuter &#3;

Worldwide spot crude oil movements fell to 30.07 mln long dwt in February from 37.25 mln tons in January and 41.44 mln in December, London shipbroker Howard Houlder said.     The decline mainly reflected a sharp drop in movements out of the Mideast Gulf, which totalled 7.4 mln tons last month against 11.65 mln in January. These included shipments to western options at 2.05 mln tons against 3.59 mln previously.     Liftings from the Gulf to eastern options fell to 4.15 mln tons from 5.94 mln and those from the Gulf to other areas dropped to 1.2 mln tons from 2.13 mln, Howard Houlder said.

livestock,carcass,grain	EC SOURCES DETAIL NEW FARM SOCIAL PACKAGE .  The 350 mln Ecu three-year package of social and structural measures agreed early today by European Community farm ministers features a plan to compensate farmers for reducing output of certain surplus products, EC Commission sources said.     The ministers agreed that under this "extensification" scheme, farmers would qualify for compensation if they cut output of specific products by at least 20 pct.     The plan would initially apply to cereals, beef, veal and wine, they added.     Cereals farmers would have to achieve their output cuts by reducing acreage, while cattle farmers would reduce their number of head and vinegrowers would cut yield. In each case, farmers would have to undertake not to step up their capacity for output of other products which are in surplus in the EC.     The sources said payment levels have not yet been fixed but will be designed to compensate farmers for loss of profit on the production they forego.     The sources said the package also contains provisions for payments to farmers who embark on a program aimed at protecting or improving the environment.     It would also mean compensatory allowances in less favoured farming areas would be extended to crops. At present such allowances are available only for livestock.     The package would provide 20 mln Ecus for research into alternative farming techniques, the sources added.     At a news conference EC Farm Commissioner Frans Andriessen said the Commission is also working on proposals to enable the EC and member states to provide direct income supports for relatively poor farmers.     Andriessen did not give full details, but said member state aid would be subject to "strict criteria to avoid distortion of competition."     EC payments would aim to help farmers to survive a difficult period while the EC tackles the problems of surplus production.     The Commission withdrew from the package agreed last night proposals to pay "early retirement" pensions to farmers aged 55 or over who gave up production. Those who took their land completely out of farm production, rather than passing it on to their heirs, would have received more generous payments.     Andriessen said the Commission plans to present revised proposals along these lines in an effort to get a scheme agreed.  Reuter &#3;
money-fx,interest	U.S., BRITAIN AGREE FURTHER BANK CAPITAL PROPOSALS .  The Bank of England and the U.S. Federal Reserve Board have agreed new proposals for joint standards to measure the risk of an array of credit exposures that do not show up in bank balance sheets, the Bank of England said.     The plan, covering swaps, forward contracts and options involving interest or exchange rates, complements proposals agreed in January between the two central banks to make commercial banks in the U.S. And Britain subject to similar standards for measuring capital adequacy, the proposal said.     It said no final decisions had been reached yet and banks have until April 16 to comment on the trunk proposals.     The Bank of England and Fed said they had faced a dilemma.     "On the one hand (we) are determined to require adequate capital support for potential future exposure -- on the other hand (we) are concerned that overly stringent capital requirements might unnecessarily affect the ability of U.S. And U.K. Banking organisations to price...Contracts competitively."      At the basis of the new proposals lies the concept of the so-called credit equivalent amount - the current value of a currency or interest rate contract and an estimate of its potential change in value due to currency or interest rate fluctuations until the contract matures.     In treatment similar to that agreed in January for balance sheet assets, the credit equivalent will be assigned one of five risk weights between zero and 100 pct, depending on the quality of the counterparty, the remaining maturity of the contract and on collaterals or guarantees to the contract, the plans showed.     The proposal showed that collaterals and guarantees would not be recognised in calculating credit equivalent amounts.     They would, however, be reflected in the assignment of risk weights. The only guarantees recognised are those given by U.S. And U.K. Governments or, in the U.S., By domestic national government agencies, the proposals showed.     The paper said the proposed rules would not cover spot foreign exchange contracts and securities traded in futures and options exchanges.     It said U.S. Regulatory authorities and the Bank of England were keen to encourage banks to "net" contracts -- consolidate multiple contracts with the same counterparty into one single agreement to create one single payments stream.     It recognised that "such arrangements may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk and wish to encourage their further development and implementation," and said some of the current proposals may be changed to take this into account.

coffee	COFFEE TALKS FAILURE SEEN PRESSURING U.S. .  Failure of talks on re-establishing International Coffee Organization, ICO, coffee quotas last week may put political pressure on the United States, particularly the State Department, to reassess its position, but the U.S. is unlikely to back away from its basic demand quotas be set by "objective criteria", U.S. officials said.     Jon Rosenbaum, assistant U.S. trade representative and head of Washington's delegation to the talks, told Reuters on his return from London that the United States is willing to resume the coffee negotiations as early as April if necessary.     Rosenbaum said the United States will be "flexible" in discussing the method of establishing objective criteria and any transition to new quotas, but not on the basic aim of establishing an objective method of setting quotas.     At the ICO talks major consuming nations, led by the U.S., proposed that future coffee export quota shares be calculated by a formula incorporating a producer's recent exportable production and verified stocks, while large producers led by Brazil proposed maintaining the traditional ad hoc division of shares. The consumer position would have in effect reduced the market share of Brazil, by far the world's largest producer.     Rosenbaum said the administration would continue to support legislation now before Congress which would allow the U.S. customs service to monitor coffee imports, as a way to comply with any future coffee quotas.     He said the Reagan administration would be reviewing the coffee policy situation following the collapse of the London talks, but "nobody is proposing we change our position."     However, other U.S. government officials involved in coffee policy said they are bracing for a diplomatic and coffee market offensive from producer countries, led by Brazil and Colombia, to soften the consumer position.     "Knowing that its next crop is fairly large, Brazil will kind of want to test the resolve of other producers and consumers," said one U.S. official.     The U.S. official, who asked not to be identified, said Brazil and Colombia may flood the coffee market in the next few months in an effort to drive down prices and pressure other countries, particularly the splinter group of small producers who differed with the major producers in London.     This in turn could lead to urgent appeals from Latin American countries, faced with mounting debt problems, to the U.S. State department, and to the National Security Council in the White House, for an easing of the U.S. position, U.S. officials said.     The State department, a major player in setting U.S. coffee policy, may then face conflicting pressures, particularly from politically-sensitive U.S. allies in Central America, U.S. officials said.     El Salvador and Guatemala both backed Brazil and Colombia at the London talks in resisting pressures for quotas based on objective criteria. But the Dominican Republic and Costa Rica joined the splinter group, which said it would agree to objective criteria.     There is a strong feeling among some in the State Department that the United States should continue to support the splinter group of producers who have taken the politically-risky step of opposing Brazil on the objective criteria question, U.S. officials said.     Within the consuming countries there also is expected to be some pressure to reassess positions.     In London, the U.S. was supported by the U.K., the Netherlands, West Germany, Japan, Australia and New Zealand on the issue of objective criteria, U.S. officials said.     This bloc represented enough votes among consuming nations to successfully prevent adoption of the producer proposals.     However, U.S. sources said West Germany's support was at times qualified and there is some concern that the European Community could come under pressure to be more accommodative to producers in future talks. France backed the Ivory Coast and other African producers during the talks.     A softening of the EC stance would make it more difficult, although not impossible, for the U.S. to block producer plans.     While political manuevering by small producers and consuming countries will be important, U.S. officials said the key to any future outcome will be Brazil's position.     U.S. officials blamed Brazil's intransigence for the failure of the talks and said a more flexible position from Brasilia would be the most important step toward agreement.  Reuter &#3;

grain,corn,sorghum,oilseed,sunseed,soybean	TORRENTIAL RAINS HALT ARGENTINE GRAIN HARVEST .  Torrential rains throughout Argentina's grain-producing areas virtually paralysed coarse grain harvesting in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.     Sunflower, maize and sorghum harvests were particularly affected, they said. But the rains proved to be a great aid to soybean crops as their harvesting will not begin until April or May.     The rains did no damage to maize, sunflower and sorghum crops though fresh rains in similar volume could reduce yields and cut the total volume of this year's harvest.     Rainfall measured between 15 and 270 mm in Buenos Aires, with the heaviest rains in the province's western sectors, between 15 and 100 mm in Cordoba, 15 and 120 mm in La Pampa, 10 and 75 mm in Santa Fe, 10 and 60 mm in Entre Rios, five and 40 mm in Misiones, and five and 50 mm in San Luis.     No rain was recorded in Corrientes, Chaco and Formosa.     Growers did not revise their estimates for total volume of the coarse grain harvest over last week's estimates.     Maize harvesting continued moving forward in central Santa Fe, though slowly. Growers had harvested seven to nine pct of total planted area, compared to five to seven pct last week.     Total maize area planted for the 1986/87 harvest was estimated at between 3.58 and 3.78 mln hectares, or two to seven pct less than the 3.85 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.     Maize production is expected to total between 10.4 and 11 mln tonnes, or a drop of 17.5 to 19.4 pct over the 12.4 to 12.6 mln tonnes harvested last year according to private estimates, or 18.9 to 21.9 pct lower than last year's volume, according to official figures.     The sunflower harvest advanced to between seven and nine pct of total planted area.     Two to 2.2 mln hectares have been planted with sunflowers for this harvest, down 29.9 to 36.3 pct from last year's figure of 3.14 mln hectares.     Sunflower production is expected to total between 2.4 mln and 2.7 mln tonnes, which would mean a drop of between 34.1 and 41.5 pct against the record 4.1 mln tonnes harvested in the 1985/86 harvest.     Grain sorghum harvesting inched forward to between two and four pct of total planted area, which this harvest is 1.23 to 1.30 mln hectares or 10.3 to 15.2 pct less than the 1.45 mln hectares planted in the 1985/86 harvest.     Sorghum production is expected to total between 3.2 mln and 3.5 mln tonnes, or 16.7 to 22 pct less than the 4.1 to 4.2 million tonnes harvested in 1985/86.     Soybean production, by contrast, is expected to hit a record 8.0 to 8.4 mln tonnes, which would mean an increase of 11.1 to 15.1 pct over last year's record figure of 7.2 to 7.3 mln tonnes, according to private estimates. Official figures put last year's soybean harvest at 7.1 mln tonnes.     Soybean crops were reported to be in generally very good condition, helped by abundant rains and high temperatures.     Total soybean-planted area for the 1986/87 harvest is expected to be a record 3.7 to 3.8 mln hectares, up 10.8 to 13.8 pct from last year's harvest figure of 3.34 mln hectares.  Reuter &#3;

grain,wheat,cotton,rice	U.S. SENATOR TO PROPOSE 0/92 FOR 1987 CROPS .  Sen. Rudy Boschwitz, R-Minn., said he intended to offer legislation that would allow 1987 producers of wheat, feedgrains, cotton and rice to receive at least 92 pct of their deficiency payments, regardless of how much they planted.     Boschwitz told the Senate Agriculture Committee that applying the so-called 0/92 provision to 1987 crops was supported by the Reagan administration and would save approximately 500 mln dlrs, including 266 mln dlrs in corn payments, 90 mln dlrs in wheat and 30 mln dlrs in cotton.     The Minnesota senator said he might offer the bill on the Senate floor or in a conference committee with the House of Representatives in the event a similar bill before the House Agriculture Committee is approved by that body.     Boschwitz told Reuters that neither he nor the U.S. Agriculture Department had decided whether or how deficiency payments should be guaranteed to farmers who might choose not to plant under the decoupling scheme.     If payments are not set in advance under decoupling, market prices conceivably could rise, thereby leading to diminished deficiency payments.     Senate Agriculture Committee Chairman Patrick Leahy, D-Vt., said he wanted to go to conference with the House as soon as possible on the issue, but would have to study the matter further before deciding how he would vote on it.

bop,trade,gnp	TURKEY SEES 1.5 BILLION DLR DEFICIT IN 1986 .  Turkey expects a 1986 balance of payments deficit of 1.5 billion dlrs, well over target, but is taking steps to improve its performance in this and other fields, Ali Tigrel, director of economic planning at the State Planning Organisation said.     He told Reuters the shortfall was a direct consequence of economic growth of nearly eight pct, up from 5.1 pct in 1985, which he said resulted mostly from a surge in domestic demand.     Tigrel acknowledged a need to cut inflation further after a drop of more than 12 points to 24.6 pct in the Treasury wholesale index last year.     This year's target of 20 pct "might be attainable but the economic management will have to be careful," he said.     Tigrel, whose department produces the annual programme which is central to the government's economic planning, said Turkey's creditworthiness was at risk over the current account shortfall, originally targeted at 695 mln dlrs.     "We must alleviate the current account substantially to sustain the creditworthiness that we have managed to secure over the last five years," he added.     His comment echoed last October's Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development report on Turkey, which said Ankara's case for more medium-term financing on better terms would look better if inflation were lower and the current account deficit cut or turned into a surplus.     "In 1987 we must reduce the rate of growth in public sector investments, we must reduce the public sector deficit as a percentage of GNP and we must achieve a very visible improvement in the current account deficit," he said.     Tigrel said a surge in public sector spending last year was also to blame for the high deficits.     Appropriations to government departments had been cut by eight pct since the budget was passed in December and foreign borrowing by municipalities had been restrained.     "We are trying make sure that public bodies stick to the investment programme and do not exceed their appropriations," he said. It was hoped to bring the public sector borrowing requirement down to five pct of GNP in 1987 from an estimated 5.6 pct in 1986.     More modest GNP growth of five pct for 1987 was also targeted, Tigrel said. Measures were being taken to encourage exports, and production incentives were being considered.     "We must try to make sure that more capacity is injected into the Turkish economy in the coming years. The promotion policy is geared to make sure that both foreign investment and local private capital come more into play as far as manufacturing capacity is concerned," Tigrel said.     He said the process of structural adjustment of the Turkish economy to free market policies, begun in 1980, was still under way. Trade had been liberalised and a freer exchange rate policy applied, but he acknowledged there was more to be done in a country where the state still dominates industry and the currency is only partially convertible.

crude	ENERGY/CALIFORNIA OIL PRODUCTION .  Drilling for oil in California is likely to continue at last year's sharply reduced levels despite recent gains in crude oil prices, industry analysts said.     Because much of the crude oil in California fields is thick, heavy and expensive to extract, oil prices would have to increase to near 1985's levels before any significant recovery is seen in drilling, they said.     "Companies will probably only drill their best prospects," said John Curti, an analyst with Birr Wilson Securities Inc.     Few new wells now are being drilled.     Only 33 rigs, about one-quarter of the total available, were drilling for oil onshore in California last week, compared to about 70 last year, said Bill Bolster of Munger Oil Information Services, which tracks California drilling activity.     "It's in the dregs right now," said Bolster of the state's drilling activity.     Current prices are not enough to justify increased drilling, said Ed Malmgreen of the California Independent Producers Association.     While an Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries pact to curb production boosted oil prices early this year, prices eventually fell.     Prices for California's marker grade, Line 63 blend, have slumped about 20 pct in the last month to 14 dlrs from a high of about 17 dlrs.     More than half of California's oil comes from stripper wells, those producing less than 10 barrels a day, and that much of that oil costs between 18 and 25 dlrs a barrel to extract, Malmgreen said.     "It's not unusual for a stripper well to cost 18 dlrs," Malmgreen said.     Many stripper wells along the southern California coast produce eight times as much water as crude oil, and inland wells frequently require the use of steam injection to spur extraction of the thick, heavy oil, he said.     The outlook for future production in California is clouded by a lack of exploratory drilling now, analysts said.     In the heart of California's oil patch, Kern County, which produces about two-thirds of the state's oil, exploratory drilling has slowed to a crawl.     Only 55 exploratory wells were drilled in Kern County in 1986, compared to 137 in 1985, according to David Mitchell of the state energy commission. So far this year only five exploratory wells have been drilled.     "I don't think they'll even get to what they did last year," Mitchell said.     No pickup in exploratory drilling is likely for the rest of the decade, Mitchell said.     Along with the fall in drilling has come a decrease in the number of producing wells and overall production.     Between February and October of 1986, the number of producing oil wells in California fell 14 pct to 43,521 from more than 50,000, said Bill Guerard of the California Energy Commission.     In line with that decrease, California's crude oil output fell about 10 pct last year due to low oil prices and is expected to remain at that lower level, analysts said.     Between February and October 1986, California's crude oil production slipped from an all-time high of 1.185 mln barrels per day to 1.066 mln bpd, Guerard said.     Total estimated crude oil production in California for 1986 was 408 mln bbls, compared with 424 mln bbls in 1985 and 405 mln bbl in 1983, according to the California Department of Conservation.     "Production in 1987 will probably hold around 1986 levels," Guerard said.  Reuter &#3;

grain	IZVESTIA SAYS SOVIET WINTER CROPS NEED RESEEDING .  The government daily Izvestia said a considerable amount of Soviet winter crops need to be reseeded and the state 1987 grain harvest target of 232 mln tonnes will not be easy to fulfil.     Without giving figures, the newspaper said: "A considerable part of the winter crops must be reseeded, but that creates extra effort in the fields in spring."     The Soviet Union has previously said nine mln hectares of winter grain will have to be reseeded because of winterkill.     A U.S. Department of Agriculture analyst in Washington has said the figure of nine mln hectares would equal about 25 pct of the total winter crop and would be the second highest winterkill in 10 years.     "The planned task of bringing in no less than 232 mln tonnes of grain is not simple," Izvestia said.     This week's sudden fall in temperatures has affected large parts of the country and has caused fieldwork to stop in the Ukraine, it said, adding that temperatures fell to as low as minus 30 centigrade in Byelorussia.

grain	U.S. SENATE PANEL MAKES CONSERVATION EXEMPTION .  The U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee approved a measure that would exempt farmers who planted alfalfa or other multiyear grasses and legumes between 1981 and 1985 from a federal conservation requirement.     Sen. Edward Zorinsky, D-Neb., said his bill would restore equity under federal sodbuster rules, which currently deny farm program benefits to farmers who, between 1981 and 1985, planted alfalfa and other multiyear grasses and legumes without interrupting the plantings with a row crop.     An official from a leading conservation group, who asked not to be identified, said the panel's move was "an unfortunate first action" because it could lead to the exemption of potentially millions of acres from the sod buster regulations, established under the 1985 farm bill.

acq	OUTBOARD MARINE &lt;OM> RISING ON TAKEOVER RUMOR .  Wall Street traders said the stock of Outboard Marine Corp was rising on a rumor over a cable television program that Outboard is a likely takeover target of Sun Chemical Corp &lt;SNL>.     Outboard was up 3-1/8 to 34-5/8. On Tuesday it rose 1-3/8 to 31-1/2 Tuesday.     A report on Cable News Network today said Sun Chemical has 4.9 pct of Outboard and is conducting a study on whether to go for control of the whole company.     An Outboard Marine spokesman would not comment on the rumor.     The cable program said a buyout of Outboard would be for up to 40 dlrs a share, or for a total of 680 mln dlrs.     A spokesman for Sun Chemical was not immediately available.     Outboard Marine last June adopted a shareholder rights plan that will be triggered when a person or group acquires beneficial ownership of 20 pct or more of its common or begins a tender offer that would result in 30 pct ownership.     Wayne Jones, vice president at Outboard for strategic planning, said management wants to stay independent. "We are not trying to sell the company. We are proceeding with our strategic plans," he said.     That plan includes integrating five boat companies that Outboard Marine has bought since the middle of December. Jones said all five will cost between 100 mln dlrs to 120 mln dlrs.     An analyst who wanted anonymity said 40 dlrs a share is a "decent" price for outboard. "A bdding war to 50 or 60 dlrs a share is stretching it. Maybe 45 dlrs a share tops," he said.     Outboard, which has 17 mln shares outstanding, is in registration for a two mln common share offering with Morgan Stanley Inc. It makes sense, the analyst said, for Sun Chemical to strike before the offering is underway.  Reuter &#3;

The size of French 1986/87 carryover barley stocks, estimated at 1.72 mln tonnes compared with 700,000 tonnes in 1985/86 is worrying, French Cereals Intervention Office (ONIC) Director Bernard Vieux said.

Vieux called on the EC Commission to help by awarding a larger volume of export certificates and said if no outlets are opened for French barley a large amount could be put into intervention.     A small amount of French barley has already been put into intervention, Vieux said without detailing the amount.     The outlook for French maize is better with 1986/87 exports to non-EC countries now put at 700,000 tonnes against 200,000 tonnes at the end of January and against 155,000 tonnes in 1985/86.

South Korea's record 7.1 billion dlrs trade surplus with the U.S. is bound to diminish as the country switches purchases from Japan in favor of U.S. companies, Trade Minister Woong-Bae Rha said.      He rejected suggestions the Korean Won is undervalued, and denied any plans for a "drastic and sudden" revaluation.     Rha is heading a trade mission to 37 U.S. cities. Last year South Korea ran a 4.3 billion dlr trade surplus, including a record 7.1 billion surplus with the U.S. and a 5.5 billion dlr deficit with Japan.     Rha told Reuters in an interview the current trade mission is looking for 2.0 billion dlrs in purchases from U.S. companies, about a quarter of which represents "transferred purchases from Japanese sources."     Rha said the items being sought by the current mission are "mainly chemicals, machinery and parts."     He said South Korea is the fourth largest importer of U.S. agricultural products. The current mission is not involved in that area but there are plans to buy "substantial amounts of cotton" from the U.S.     He noted his country "is clearly not as open as the American market. Nor is it reasonable to expect that it should be," considering South Korea has a 40 billion dlr foreign debt and spends six pct of its gross national product on defense.  Reuter &#3;

"This is really getting pretty serious. We're talking nuts and bolts economic survival and whether it's worthwhile for farmers to put in a crop."     Farm leaders and economists have estimated the board will recommend cuts of around 20 pct in the initial prices.     Farmers receive the initial payment when the grain is delivered to the elevators used by the wheat board.     If the wheat board, which markets most of Canada's grain, obtains higher than expected prices on world markets, the farmers receive a final payment at the end of the crop year. If prices are lower, the federal treasury makes up the difference.     The final decision on the initial prices, usually made in April, rests with Wheat Board Minister Charles Mayer and the federal cabinet.     Last year Mayer cut the initial prices between 19 and 27 pct but last fall the government announced a one billion Canadian dlr aid program to compensate for the price cuts.     But federal agricultural officials have already warned farmers not to depend on additional government aid this year.  Reuter &#3;
trade	GATT COUNCIL DEFERS DECISION ON SEMICONDUCTORS .  The ruling GATT Council deferred a decision on whether to set up a dispute panel on the basis of a European Community complaint against the U.S.- Japanese agreement on exports of computer semiconductors.     David Woods, spokesman of the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), told a news briefing that the main parties would continue bilateral talks. This was in the hope of resolving the row before the next Council meeting on April 15.     The five-year accord signed in July 1986 aims to protect the U.S. Market from dumping of low-price Japanese microchips, officially known as semiconductors.     The E.C. Complained the accord breached GATT trade rules by allowing Tokyo to monitor prices, allowing it to set minimum prices for Japanese chips sold in third countries.     The 12-nation Community also charged the agreement gave U.S. Producers preferential access to the Japanese market.     Woods said many nations -- Hong Kong, Canada, Switzerland, Singapore, Sweden, Malaysia and Nigeria -- had supported the EC complaint during the heated Council debate.     Japan's delegate, Minoru Endo, and U.S. Ambassador Michael Samuels replied in the debate that the E.C. Charges were unfounded, but they were willing to continue bilateral talks.  Reuter &#3;

earn	TALKING POINT/GENERAL MOTORS &lt;GM> .  General Motors Corp staged an explosive rally on Wall Street after a share buyback program announced yesterday, but analysts said GM's future remains clouded by stiff competition and erosion of market share.     GM shares rose 3-1/2 to 79-1/8 in active trading. Analysts agreed that investors liked the repurchase program but they  differed sharply over the carmaker's long term prospects.     "I'm very positive on GM," said Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co. "They're clearly committed to enhancing shareholder value."     However, some analysts worry about how GM will pay for the buyback and whether new models will enable the carmaker to recapture lost market share.     After the market had closed yesterday, GM said it would buy back 20 pct of its common stock by the end of 1990. The announcement sent investors today scrambling for GM shares, with more than 3.2 mln shares changing hands by mid-day.     The buyback plan caused several analysts bullish on the stock to reiterate buy recommendations this morning, and at least one increased his earnings estimates for GM based on a good performance expected from new car models.     But David Healy of Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc said the repurchase program is not a positive.     "The buyback doesn't really change the earnings outlook and puts more stress on the balance sheet," he said, since GM will have to borrow money to pay for the stock purchases. The stock should settle back down to around 76, he added.     Healy projects GM will earn five dlrs a share in 1987 and 5.50 dlrs in 1988, compared to 1986 earnings of 8.21 dlrs. Healy's numbers are near the low end of Wall Street estimates, which range from five dlrs to 7.80 dlrs in 1987 and from four dlrs to 10.80 dlrs in 1988.     Like other analysts, Healy sees GM's share of the domestic car and truck market falling in 1987. "On balance, GM cars are not selling as well as their competitors," he said.     In late February, GM car sales fell 8.6 pct from the year-ago period while competitors Ford Motor Co &lt;F> and Chrysler Corp &lt;C> both posted increases. But GM said February sales showed improvement over January, adding that it expects improvement in coming months.     Overall, GM's share of U.S. car and truck sales should fall to around 38 or 39 pct in 1987 from 41 pct at the end of 1986, analysts said. The numbers include imports.     Kidder Peabody's Kirnan said cost reductions and product improvements this year should lead to positive cash flow by the fourth quarter, which will help GM finance the buyback.     "GM (stock) has been a real laggard and now it's rolling up its sleeves and getting serious. I think there's a major earnings surprise in the winds," he said.     Kirnan raised his earnings estimates slightly today, in part in reaction to the announced buyback, and sees GM earning 5.65 dlrs this year and 9.75 dlrs in 1988. "The company is more concerned than ever about improving their relative valuation with respect to Ford and Chrysler," he said.     Another positive for the stock is GM's dividend, currently five dlrs a share annually, which gives it a higher yield than its competitors, Kirnan said. And GM will raise the cash dividend 25 to 50 cts a share next year, he predicted.     But analyst Michael Lucky of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc said U.S. car sales will weaken, and GM's new products, if successful, will only slow but not halt the erosion of its market share.     "I believe their new cars will be successful, but that will only curtail losses in market share," which will fall to around 35 pct by 1990, Lucky said.     Philip Fricke of Goldman Sachs and Co falls in the middle of the bulls and bears. While he is recommending GM stock, he said results will not improve until 1988.     "I'm not looking for improvement this year. This is a transition year for GM," he said.     Fricke, who estimates 1987 earnings at 7.80 dlrs and 1988 at 10.80 dlrs, said cost cutting and new car models will not affect 1987 results. "But the key thing isn't so much what they earn this year. It's the momentum beyond this year that's important."  Reuter &#3;

earn	TOTAL STILL EXPECTS 1.5 BILLION FRANC 1986 LOSS .  French oil group Total Cie Francaise des Petroles &lt;TPN.PA> is still expecting a 1.5 billion franc consolidated net loss, including minority interests, for 1986, after taking account of stock losses of 7.5 billion francs, the company said in a communique after a board meeting here.     In late January group president Francois-Xavier Ortoli told journalists that the slump in oil prices and the weak dollar had caused the stock depreciation, turning a consolidated net profit, before losses on stocks, of six billion francs into a consolidated net loss of 1.5 billion francs.     Earlier today Armand Guilbaud, president of Total's refining and distribution subsidiary Cie de Raffinage-Distribution (CRD) Total France &lt;RAFF.PA>, told journalists that 1986 had marked a return to profit for the subsidiary before stock depreciation.     CRD made a net profit before stock depreciation and currency factors of 1.95 billion francs last year after a 1.16 billion loss in 1985.     But its net loss last year, taking account of that depreciation as well as currency fluctuations, was 1.16 billion francs after a 1.05 billion loss in 1985.     In 1986 CRD's sales fell 5.7 pct to 19.7 mln tonnes from 20.9 mln "due to the growth in imports by independent distributors following a relaxation of regulations," Guilbaud said.     The subsidiary is expecting to cut its workforce to 6,000 this year and 5,000 in 1988 from 6,800 last year, under a job reduction scheme which will eventually save the group 600 mln francs, he said.     Concerning business in 1987, he said that "January was a good month, but the situation deteriorated in February."  Reuter &#3;

crude	TEXAS OIL REGULATOR CALLS FOR STATE TAX BREAKS .  Texas Railroad Commissioner James Nugent, saying that the ailing oilpatch cannot wait for Congress to act, today urged Texas state lawmakers to adopt incentives to find new oil reserves and to exempt severance taxes on oil produced from stripper wells.     Nugent said in a speech to the Texas house of representatives that the state must take the initiative in molding U.S. energy policy and finding new ways to assist troubled oil producers.     His proposal to revitalize Texas' oil industry would exempt stripper wells that produce 10 barrels of oil or less each day from the state's 4.6 pct severance tax. He said that the majority of Texas' oil wells fall within the stripper well category and a price swing of two to three dlrs a barrel can be crucial in determining if the well remains in production.     Nugent also called for state lawmakers to exempt new wildcat wells from the state severance tax for up to five years as a financial incentive to explore for new oil reserves.     Secondary and tertiary oil production, expensive methods of production that inject water or gas into the ground to recover oil, should also be exempted from the severance tax, Nugent said. His plan would exempt existing secondary and tertiary wells that produce at a rate of less than three barrels a day for three years, or until the price of oil reaches $25 a barrel.     "We've been sitting back and waiting on two federal administrations to develop a coherent energy policy for the nation to follow. I say we have waited long enough," Nugent said. "In other words, let's tell Washington to either lead, follow, or get out of the way."     Nugent said that the financial losses to the state treasury by exempting marginal oil production from state severance taxes would be more than made up by stimulating new business for the oil supply and service industry.

coffee	COLOMBIA BLASTS U.S. FOR COFFEE TALKS FAILURE .  Colombian finance minister Cesar Gaviria blamed an inflexible U.S. position for the failure of last week's International Coffee Organisation, ICO, talks on export quotas.     "We understand that the U.S. Position was more inflexible than the one of Brazil, where current economic and political factors make it difficult to adopt certain positions," Gaviria told Reuters in an interview.     The U.S. and Brazil have each laid the blame on the other for the breakdown in the negotiations to re-introduce export quotas after being extended through the weekend in London.     Gaviria stressed that Colombia tried to ensure a successful outcome of the London talks but he deplored that intransigent attitudes, both from producing and consuming nations, made it impossible.     In a conversation later with local journalists, Gaviria said the U.S. attitude would have serious economic and political consequences, not necessarily for a country like Colombia but certainly for other Latin American nations and for some African countries.     He told Reuters that Colombia, because of the relatively high level of its coffee stocks, would probably suffer less.     According to Gaviria, Colombia can hope to earn about 1,500 mln dlrs this calendar year from coffee exports, which traditionally account for 55 pct of the country's total export revenue.     That estimate would represent a drop in revenues of 1,400 mln dlrs from 1986.     Colombia, which held stockpiles of 10.5 mln bags at the start of the current coffee year, exported a record 11.5 mln bags in the 1985/86 coffee year ending last September 30.  Reuter &#3;

Pacific Telesis Group chairman Donald Guinn told a meeting of security analysts that the company sees continued earnings growth in 1987 above the 1.08 billion dlrs, or 5.02 dlrs per share, earned in 1986.     Guinn also said that capital spending stood at about 1.8 billion dlrs in 1986, and the company expected the figure to remain flat each year through 1989. He noted that all captial spending will be internally financed.     Guinn also told analysts that the company faced some regulatory uncertainties in ongoing rate cases at its Pacific Bell operating company.     In rates hearings before, the California Public Utility Commission, Guinn said the company faced a potential 76 mln dlr revenue reduction, and due to ongoing discussions with the commission, he said the figure might even be greater.     The company also faces some opposition to a 225 mln dlr rate hike requested for 1986. Guinn said the commission found 180 mln dlrs of the hike was based on questionable calculations and assumptions, while 45 mln dlrs might represented unneeded modernization costs.     Guinn also said that the company is still studying whether to join an international consortium that plans to lay a transpacific telephone cable between the U.S. and Japan.     "We have not agreed to anything," Guinn said, but added he would soon recieve a feasibility study on the venture and the company would make a decision soon on participating.     Asked by an analyst about the recent recommendation by the U.S. Department of Justice which would allow the Bell operating companies to offer limited long distance services, Guinn said the company would likely shy away from that type of expansion.     "(Long distance services) is a very competitive business. It's a commodity business and becoming more so," he said. "I'm not so sure we would be interested in getting back into that business."     However, Guinn generally applauded the U.S. recommendations, saying they would give more latitude for the Bell operating companies to expand into non-regulated businesses and provide more flexibility to form strategic alliances with other companies.     He added that while the company welcomes the expansion into new areas, it is not currently involved in any acqusition talks. "We do not have anything actively under consideration," he said.

interest,money-fx	NEW BANK RULES TOUGHER THAN NEEDED, DEALERS SAY .  U.S. and U.K. bank regulators are asking banks to set aside more reserves than is necessary to cushion them against the risks posed by the interest rate and currency swap transactions they carry, swap dealers said.     After viewing proposed guidelines released jointly today by the Bank of England and the Federal Reserve Board, dealers said that in effect, regulators are asking them to set aside reserves twice for the same risk.     Market participants will have 60 days to respond to the proposals.     Adoption of stiffer capital requirements is especially significant in the eurobond markets, which saw new issue volume of about 183 billion dlrs in 1986 according to figures compiled by Euromoney magazine. While no firm figures exist, dealers in eurobonds estimate that 80 pct of all new issues are involved in some swap arrangement. Separately, the ISDA estimates that about 300 billion dlrs worth of swap transactions are outstanding. Kenneth McCormick, co-chairman of the International Swap Dealers Association (ISDA) and President of Kleinwort Benson Cross Financing Inc, said that the Association has no comment and will study the proposals.     "What they are proposing is really double counting," Patrick de Saint-Aignan, managing director of swaps for Morgan Stanley and Co, said. Instead, he argues, banks should either be required to hold a percentage of the face value -- say one pct per year to maturity -- or to hold a percentage of the cost of replacing the contract in the event of a counterparty default.     "The potential risk factors are very large relative to what we had expected," said a director at one U.K. merchant bank. "What they are really doing is asking you to capitalize now -- to borrow money now -- to cushion you against risk you might have 10 years from now," he added.(Adds title first paragraph).     Dealers also said they believe that banks not covered by the agreement, such as those based in Japan, will have a competitive advantage because they will not have to pass the costs on to customers.     Indeed, regulators are apparently also concerned about the exclusion of other countries from the new requirements. Federal Reserve Board Governor Martha Seger, following approval of the proposed guidelines by the Fed, said she is concerned that Japan was not involved in the U.K.-U.S. effort to draft new capital rules.      Dealers said they were somewhat relieved to see that bank regulators recognized the concept of netting, that is, offsetting the amounts receiveable from and payable to a single counterparty against each other.     The paper said that regulatory authorities "recognize that such arrangements (netting) may in certain circumstances reduce credit risk." Furthermore, the paper said, if a netting agreement could be reached that would withstand legal tests, it might be willing to reduce capital requirements accordingly.     But dealers said they fear regulators may insist on an airtight netting agreement that is impossible to design.      "One problem is that there has never been a major default in the swaps market. So we don't know if any of the swap arrangements will really stand up in court," said one bank official.  Reuter &#3;

Dynamics, which now owns 27.5 pct of CTS' outstanding stock, said it agreed to limit its shareholdings to not more than 35 pct of the outstanding shares for a year following the company's 1987 annual meeting.     Dynamics said the CTS board will recommend CTS shareholders vote at the 1987 annual meeting in favor of the company paying Dynamics 2,178,000 dlrs as a reimbursement for its CTS releated costs and granting Dynamics an option to buy enough CTS common at 29.625 dlrs a share to give it ownership of 35 pct of the outstanding stock.     Dynamics said the price of stock under the option, exercisable for one year, is based on the average closing price for the stock for the five days ending March two.     Dynamics said CTS Chairman George F. Sommer will assume the additional title of President. Former President Robert D. Hostetler is resigning as a director, as is Chief Financial Officer Gary B. Erekson, Ted Ross and Donald J. Kacek.     Dynamics said the CTS board will be reduced to seven members for eight with the remaining four members of the current board and three representatives of Dynamics as new directors.  Reuter &#3;
grain	RENEWAL OF U.S./USSR GRAIN PACT SAID UNCERTAIN .  Prospects for renewal of the five-year U.S./USSR grains agreement are uncertain at this point, a Soviet trade official told Reuters.     The current trade imbalance between the United States and the Soviet Union, high U.S. commodity prices, and increased world grain production make a renewal of the supply agreement next year less certain, Albert Melnikov, deputy trade representative of the Soviet Union, said in an interview.     The current agreement expires on Sept 30, 1988.     Melnikov said that world grain markets are different than when the first agreement was signed in 1975.     Statements from both U.S. and Soviet officials have indicate that a long term grains agreement might not be as attractive for both sides as it once was.     "We have had one agreement. We have had a second agreement, but with the second agreement we've had difficulties with prices," Melnikov said.     "I cannot give you any forecasts in response to the future about the agreement.... I do not want to speculate on what will happen after Sept 30, 1988," he said.     Melnikov noted that he has seen no indications from Soviet government officials that they would be pushing for a renewal of the agreement.     "The situation is different in comparison to three, five or ten years ago ... We can produce more," he said.  Reuter &#3;

Trans World Airlines said it has proposed a cash merger of USAir Group with TWA in which the holders of USAir common would receive 52 dlrs in cash in exchange for their stock.     TWA said the offer was made in a letter to Edmin Colodny, chairman and president of USAir.     TWA said, however, that if the negotiated deal is not acceptable it may make an offer directly to USAir's shareholders for up to 51 pct of USAir's outstanding stock, to be purchased in a voting trust at a price lower than today's offer.     TWA said it is filing an application with the Department of Transportation seeking approval of the merger as well as an application for approval, on an expedited basis, of its purchase of up to 51 pct of USAir common and the deposit of the stock in a voting trust, pending DOT approval.     TWA said that in respect to USAir's recent offer for Piedmont Aviation &lt;PIE> it believes that USAir's shareholders would prefer a cash merger proposal for USAir over its proposed acquisition of Piedmont.     TWA said, however, it also would be interested in discussing a three way deal among USAir, Piedmont and TWA.     TWA said the merger is subject to the USAir board redeeming the preferred stock purchase rights (the poison pill) issued to shareholders last year and taking action so that the vote of a majority of the outstanding common stock is required to approve its proposed move.     Additionally, TWA said it would need a satisfactory due diligence review of USAir.

livestock,carcass,trade	MORE PRESSURE URGED FOR ASIA TO TAKE U.S. BEEF .  Congressmen from beef producing states and representatives of the U.S. livestock industry  urged the Reagan administration to press Japan and South Korea to open up their markets to imports of beef.     Testifying at a House subcommittee hearing on livestock issues, Rep. Hal Daub (R-Nebr.), said the administration should push hard for greater beef imports by Japan and South Korea. Daub was joined by several other lawmakers.     U.S. assistant trade representative Suzanne Earley, replied "we're not going to let Japan off the hook, or Korea." She noted trade representative Clayton Yeutter met with a senior Korean official last week on the beef issue, and that Yeutter and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng will visit Tokyo in April for discussions on farm trade issues.     Japan maintains a quota on beef imports, set at 58,400 tonnes high quality beef in fiscal 1987. South Korea has banned beef imports but there are indications Seoul may bow to U.S. pressure and allow some imports soon, industry officials said.

grain,corn,wheat	MORE SOVIET GRAIN BUYING FROM U.S. TIED TO PRICE .  Whether the Soviet Union will fulfill its buying obligations under the U.S./USSR grains agreement depends entirely on the United States, a Soviet trade official told Reuters.     "How can I tell that we are ready to fulfill the agreement if the United States does not want to offer us grain at competitive prices?" said Albert Melnikov, deputy trade representative of the Soviet Union to the United States.     "We are in the market for grains, but it is up to the United States to be the seller ... to offer Soviets competitive prices," he said in an interview.     Melnikov said that the United States has not lived up the agreement by failing to make available to Moscow U.S. grain at prevailing market prices.     "We are being accused of not implementing this agreement. We do not consider we are at fault," Melnikov said.     Article I in the agreement states that "purchases/sales of commodities under this Agreement will be made at the market price prevailing for these products at the time of purchase/sale and in accordance with normal commercial terms."     "The United States should supply to the Soviet Union definite quantities of grain at competitive prices ... Is the United States ready to supply this?" he said.     The Soviet official said that near-term corn demand has been met by the recent Soviet purchases of U.S. corn, which he confirmed at 1.5 mln tonnes, but said that if U.S. corn prices remain competitive, the Soviets will buy more if they need it.     Wheat buying, however, is a different story, Melnikov said.     "If the United States is interested in selling its wheat, then they must offer competitive prices, and it's up to the United States to decide how these competitive prices will be offered," he said.     Last year's U.S. offer of subsidized wheat to the Soviets was rejected because of an insufficient subsidy, Melnikov said. He said that at the time of the 13 dlr per tonne subsidy offer, U.S. wheat prices were 26 dlrs over world levels.  Reuter &#3;

The directors of the American Farm Bureau, the nation's largest farm organization, voted Tuesday to urge Congress to leave the 1985 farm bill in place without alterations.     "We are solidly opposed to opening up the 1985 farm bill," said Dean Kleckner, president. "The current farm bill has been in place for just a little over a year and in our judgment there is more to be gained at the present time from maintaining the legislation.     "Several independent studies ... indicate the 1985 farm bill is better on balance than any of the alternatives being advanced," Kleckner said.     The Farm Bureau also urged Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng to adjust the loan rate for 1987 crop soybeans as much as he deems possible under the farm bill to keep soybeans competitive in the world market.     A Farm Bureau proposal suggests that producers should be eligible for supplemental payments in the form of PIK certificates for the difference between 5.02 dlrs a bushel and the new loan rate.

Sumner Redstone, president of National Amusements, Inc, predicted he can win regulatory approvals to wrap up the 3.4 billion dlr acquisition of Viacom International Inc in 60 to 90 days.     Redstone, 63, catapulted himself into the big leagues of entertainment early today when a group of Viacom managers and their financial backers decided not to top National's bid.     "We've had counsel working for some time in every region where Viacom has cable televison systems" Redstone told Reuters in a telephone interview.     Redstone also said "Viacom is committed to working very closely with us to obtain approvals." Viacom has been seeking approvals for transfer of its broadcast licenses and cable systems since September when its management group first advanced a buyout plan.     But Redstone turned the situation into a spirited bidding contest which was capped by the announcement this morning that Viacom's independent directors on behalf of Viacom entered into a defintive merger agreement with National.     National is a family business which operates a chain of movie theaters. It is dwarfed by Viacom.     Redstone said he was weary after talks dragged on through the night but also excited at the prospect of running a leading electronic media company. He noted that the number of motion picture admissions in the U.S. has shown no growth in 15 years.     Of nine satellite television channels operated by Viacom, four are motion-picture oriented pay channels. Redstone said exclusive contracts with pay television networks are the emerging trend. "Up until recently you could see any motion picture on any pay channel," Redstone said.     He noted Viacom has exclusive agreements with two studios and plans to sign a deal with a third company next month.     Redstone said the management group's investment bankers will be paid what is due for termination of its merger agreement. Such fees could total about 30 mln dlrs. "That will be a company expense," Redstone said.     He said BankAmerica &lt;BAC> Corp has had numerous inquiries from lenders who want to participate in a 2.25 billion dlr financing for the deal. BankAmerica will provide 592 mln dlrs.     After the merger, Viacom will be a subsidiary of National but 17 pct of the company will be in public hands.  Reuter &#3;
trade	BRITISH AIDE CRITICIZES U.S.PROTECTIONISM .  A senior British official said that protectionist bills being considered by Congress could trigger retaliation by the European Community (EEC) and threaten the global trading system.     Paul Channon, secretary for trade and industry, said if Congress passed legislation to curb textile imports, which would hit EC shipments as well as shipments from major Asian textile producers, "the community would have to retaliate."     His comments echoed those made yesterday by Belgian Trade Minister Herman De Croo, who said if the bill passed, the community would retaliate by imposing taxes on U.S. exports.     Channon made his remarks at a news conference after two days of talks with Reagan Administration officials and members of Congress.     De Croo was also in Washington for trade talks.     Channon said there was a greater protectionism sentiment in Congress since his visit here last year as Congress and the Administration tried to find ways to reduce the U.S. trade deficit, which last year hit a record 169.8 billion dlrs.     Channon also called for greater EC-U.S. cooperation to force Japan to open its markets to foreign goods.     Channon said Japan's trade surplus is causing everyone problems - its surplus with the United States last year was 51.5 billion dlrs and with EC nations, 16.7 billion dlrs.     "The more united pressure there could be, the better," he said.     Channon also called for increased U.S.-EC cooperation to avoid trade disputes.     He said the two sides narrowly avoided a confrontation earlier this year over lost grains sales when Spain and Portugal joined the community and its liberal imports regulations were tightened to conform to EC standards.     "But if both sides drew back from the brink that time," he said, ""it does not mean that they would do so on another occasion."     Channon added that "There is increasing reesentment in Europe over the U.S. tactic of negotiating under the pressure of unilaterally imposed deadlines."     He said other potential conflicts are already in sight - alleged European government subsidies of Airbus aircraft and taxes on fats and oils - and "the commuity and the United States must therefore learn to manage their relations better."     He said another bill to let the United States retaliate against a nation if that nation's market was not open to U.S. goods would bypass the trade pact GATT (General Agreeeement on Tariffs and Trade) as an arbiter of trade practices.     He said foreign trade law should be judged by GATT and not by the United States, adding "if the (trade) law is to be interpreted by the United States and not by the GATT, what is to happen to the rest of us?"      reuter &#3;

Testifying before the House Appropriations subcommittee which must approve his agency's 1988 budget, he said, "In my judgment economic factors justify a continued decline."

China's 1986/87 sugar crop has been revised to 5.26 mln tonnes (raw value), down four pct from the previous forecast and five pct below the previous season, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     In its World Production and Trade Report, the department attributed the decline to relatively poor profitability of sugar, causing harvested area of cane and beets to decline seven pct from 1985/86.     Beet sugar production for 1986/87 is now estimated at 837,000 tonnes, five pct less than earlier forecast and down five pct from the previous season, while cane output is projected at 4.423 mln tonnes, down four pct from previously forecast and five pct below the previous season, it said.

acq	TWA &lt;TWA> TANGLES PIEDMONT &lt;PIE> SITUATION .  Trans World Airlines Inc complicated the bidding for Piedmont Aviation Inc by offering either to buy Piedmont suitor USAir Group or, alternatively, to merge with Piedmont and USAir.     Piedmont's board was meeting today, and Wall Street speculated the board was discussing opposing bids from Norfolk Southern Corp and USAir. The TWA offer was announced shortly after the Piedmont board meeting was scheduled to begin.     TWA offered to buy USAir for 52 dlrs cash per share. It also said it was the largest shareholder of USAir and threatened to go directly to USAir shareholders with an offer for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price.     TWA also said it believed its offer was a better deal for USAir shareholders than an acquisition of Piedmont, but it said it alternatively would discuss a three-way combination of the airlines.     Market sources and analysts speculated that TWA chairman Carl Icahn made the offer in order to put his own airline into the takeover arena.     "We're just wondering if he's not just trying to get TWA into play. There's speculation on the street he just wants to move onto somthing else," said one arbitrager. "We think TWA might just be putting up a trial balloon."     Analysts said the offer must be taken seriously by USAir, but that the airline will probably reject it because the price is relatively low compared to other airline deals.     They also said Icahn must prove his offer credible by revealing financing arrangements. "They need to show their commitment and their ability to finance. I think it's a credible offer," said Timothy Pettee, a Bear Stearns analyst.     "I think it's certainly on the low end of relative values of airline deals," said Pettee. Pettee estimated 58 dlrs would be in a more reasonable range based on other airline mergers.     USAir stock soared after TWA made public its offer. A spokesman for USAir declined comment, and said USAir had not changed its offer for Piedmont. USAir offered of buy 50 pct of that airline's stock for 71 dlrs cash per share and the balance for 73 dlrs per share in USAir stock.     USAir closed up 5-3/8 at 49-1/8 on volume of 1.9 mln shares.     Piedmont, which slipped 1/2 to close at 69-5/8, also remained silent on the TWA action. Piedmont has an outstanding 65 dlr cash per share offer from Norfolk Southern Corp.     Norfolk Southern declined comment, but said it stuck with its offer for Piedmont. Norfolk owns about 20 pct of Piedmont and opened the bidding when it said it would propose a takeover of Piedmont.     Some analysts said Icahn may be trying to acquire USAir to make his own airline a more attractive takeover target.     "Icahn I think had wanted to sell his airline and there were no takers. I think the strategy might have called for making his investment more attractive. One way to accomplish that specific objective is to go out and acquire other airlines," said Andrew Kim of Eberstadt Fleming.     "I don't know whose going to buy them, but at least this way it becomes a much more viable package," said Kim.     But Icahn's financing ability for such a transaction remains in doubt, in part because of TWA's heavy debt load.     Wall street sources said TWA has some cash with which to do the offer.     The sources said Icahn has not lined up outside financial advisers and plans to make his own arrangements.    Icahn earlier this year abandoned plans to buy USX Corp &lt;X> and still retains 11 pct of that company's stock.     Some Wall street sources said the financier's USX plan was impacted by the cloud hanging over his adviser, Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, because of Wall Street's insider trading scandal.     Industry sources also predicted USAir might reject the TWA offer on price and financing concerns. "It's littered with contingencies and it doesn't even have a financing arrangement," said one executive at another major airline.     But the executive conceded a merged TWA-USAir would be a strong contender with USAir's east coast route system and planned west coast presence from PSA. USAir could feed the intenrational flights of TWA, which has a midwest presence in its St. Louis hub. Adding Piedmont, dominant in the southeast, to the mix would develop an even stronger force.     The combined entity would also have TWA's pars reservation system.     Such a merger would be complex and analysts said it would result in an airline iwth an 18 pct market share.      Reuter &#3;

U.S. Trade Representative Clayton Yeutter said he plans a July trip to China to discuss trade issues including China's admission to the General Agreements on Tariffs and Trade.     Yeutter told a congressional hearing it was possible China could be a member of GATT before the end of the year.     "They are making major moves to becoming a full scale member of the world economy," he told the House Appropriations subcommittee which oversees his agency's budget.     Depending on how the negotiations go on the terms of China's GATT membership, Yeutter said he could put the final touches on the U.S. part of the agreement during his trip.     The admission of China to GATT, which is the multinational group of nations which negotiates international rules on trade, would offer both potential export markets and potential competition for U.S. industries, he said.     "That has a lot of potential as well as risks for U.S. business," Yeutter said.     "I think China will develop into a fine market for us," he added.  Reuter &#3;
coffee	RIO COFFEE TRADE PREFERS NO PACT TO QUOTA CUT .  The failure of talks to introduce new coffee export quotas within the International Coffee Agreement, ICA, was preferable to the alternative of Brazil having a sharply reduced quota, as had been proposed, President of the Rio de Janeiro Coffee Trade Association Carlos Calmon said.     He told Reuters proposals to reduce Brazil's quota to 25 pct of the world share from 30 pct at present were unacceptable as the country has large stocks and a good harvest is expected.     "Brazil has the capacity to export 20 mln bags this year," Calmon added.     Calmon said, assuming a 58 mln bag global ICA quota, Brazil's share under the proposals would have been 14.5 mln bags, of which soluble would have accounted for 2.0 mln, leaving just 12.5 mln bags of green coffee for export.     "It's a pity the talks broke down, but for Brazil this was better than such a quota reduction," he added.     In 1985 Brazil exported 19.6 mln bags of soluble and green coffee, including about two mln bags to non-members. A severe drought and marketing problems cut exports last year to under 10 mln bags.     Calmon estimated stocks as of January 1 at 18 mln bags, of which 5.0 mln have already been sold for export. The harvest this year should be around 30 mln bags, he added.     The latest Brazilian Coffee Institute estimate for last year's harvest is 11.2 mln bags, although many traders believe it was higher than this.  Reuter &#3;

Bank of Canada Governor John Crow said he expects the Canadian economy will grow moderately in the coming year, despite the near flat growth in the final quarter of 1986.     "We see moderate growth," Crow told a news conference following presentation of the central bank's annual report in the House of Commons today.

acq,earn	ALLIS-CHALMERS &lt;AH> PROPOSES RESTRUCTURING .  Allis-Chalmers Corp said it asked lenders and other groups to approve a restructuring plan that would cause a dilution of the company's existing common stock.     The company said it would sell all of its businesses other than the American Air Filter business, make a public financing of more than 100 mln dlrs and pay part of the currently outstanding debt with the proceeds.     Under the plan, which was presented to institutional lenders, the company's unions and the Pension Benefit Guaranty Corp, "substantial amounts" of institutional debt would be converted to common stock of the restructured company.     Allis-Chalmers said it will exchange existing preferred stock for common. The exchange of the institutional debt and preferred stock for common equity will cause a "resulting dilution of the existing common stock," Allis-Chalmers said in a statement.     Under the plan, holders of existing common would hold about 15 pct of the restructured common stock. Holders of existing preferred would hold about 35 pct of the new common.     Allis-Chalmers said its only alternative to the plan is bankruptcy. The restructuring must be approved by creditors, common and preferred holders,and present and former employees.     Allis-Chalmers said a bankruptcy filing "appears to represent the company's only alternative if agreement upon the terms of the plan cannot be reached."     The spokesman said in response to an inquiry that he was not aware of any extraordinary charge against earnings that would result from the restructuring.     "It is too early to talk about a charge" because the plan must still be approved by the lenders and unions, he said.     Also under the plan, payments to Allis-Chalmers' private lenders would be deferred. Trade payables and obligations incurred in the ordinary course of business will be met.     Payment of health benefits for active and retired employees would be made "at substantially reduced levels."     Allis-Chalmers, once one of the leading farm equipment companies, sold all of its farm equipment operations to Deutz of West Germany for 107 mln dlrs, leaving the company with businesses in lift trucks, air conditioning, fluids handling and solid materials processing.     Last year, Allis-Chalmers sold the lift truck business to AC Material Handling Co of Columbus, Ohio.     Under the restructuring plan, Allis-Chalmers will sell its solid materials processing and fluids handling businesses. Solid materials processing, which makes equipment to crush stones for highway construction, accounted for 288 mln dlrs of Allis-Chalmers's total 1985 revenues of 886 mln dlrs.     The company will also sell its fluids handling operations, which makes pumps and valves. That business accounted for 196 mln dlrs of the company's 1985 revenues.     Allis-Chalmers in 1986 reported a net loss of 8.6 mln dlrs, or 1.09 dlrs a share. In 1985, the company lost 168.4 mln dlrs, or 12.27 dlrs a share.

Ivory Coast today predicted that the present coffee price crash recorded after the collapse of the recent International Coffee Organisation (ICO) meeting in London would not last long.     Commenting on Monday's failure by producer and consumer nations to agree on new export quotas needed to tighten an oversupplied coffee market, Ivorian Agriculture Minister Denis Bra Kanon told reporters that traders would eventually be obliged to restore their positions.     "I am convinced the market is going to reverse by April," he told a news conference here at his return from the failed London talks.     Robusta coffee beans for May delivery ended the day in London down about 50 sterling at 1,265 sterling a tonne, the lowest since 1982.     Bra Kanon estimated at at least 535 billion CFA francs (1.76 billion dlrs) the overall loss in revenues earned by Ivory Coast from all its commodities exports this year if the slide on the world markets continues.     He disclosed that his country - the world's biggest cocoa producer and the third largest for coffee -- would spearhead an African initiative to reach a compromise formula by the end of next month.     Ivory Coast has been chosen by the Abidjan-based Inter-African Coffee Organisation (IACO) to speak on behalf of the continent's 25 producer nations at the London talks.     "An initiative from IACO is likely very soon," he said without elaborating.     "Following the London collapse, we have immediately embarked on a concertation course to avoid breaking an already fragile market," he said.     Questioned by journalists, the minister said President Felix Houphouet-Boigny estimated for the moment that his government would not be forced to reduce the price guaranteed by the state to Ivorian coffee-growers for the current season.     Last year, the West African nation announced that the coffee producer price would stay at 200 CFA francs (65 cents) per kilo.     Bra Kanon said that his country would strive to diversify its agricultural production to avoid beeing too dependent from world market fluctuation.     A communique read over the state-run television tonight said that during today's weekly cabinet meeting, the veteran Ivorian leader reaffirmed "his faith in Ivory Coast's bright (economic) future" despite the commodities price slide.     The Agriculture Minister also announced the government decided to earmark a sum of 7.5 billion CFA francs (24.71 mln dlrs) to support the country's small farmers.     Financially-strapped Ivory Coast, long regarded as one of Africa's showpiece economies, is going through difficult times following the sharp slump in the world price of cocoa and coffee.     Ivory Coast's real gross domestic product is expected to grow only one pct this year compared to five pct in 1986, according to a recent Finance Ministry estimate.  Reuter &#3;

Dlrs in January from 203 mln, revised from 207 mln, in December and 305 mln in January 1986, in a smoothed measurement, the Statistics Department said.     Unsmoothed figures show a deficit of 162 mln dlrs for January against 107 mln, revised from 75 mln for December 1986 and 575 mln in January 1986.     The smoothed series -- adjusted to iron out random fluctuations -- shows a widening surplus on merchandise trade to 46 mln from a surplus of 33 mln, revised from 43 mln dlrs in December and a 71 mln deficit in the a year ago period.     Exports were 905 mln dlrs against 929 mln, revised from 971 mln in December and 816 mln a year earlier, while imports fell to 858 mln from 895 mln, revised from 928 mln in December and 888 mln in January 1986.     Unadjusted merchandise figures show a surplus of 53 mln dlrs vs 141 mln, revised from 203 mln surplus in December 1986 and a 323 mln deficit a year earlier.     The deficit on invisibles on unsmoothed figures eased to 215 mln dlrs from 248 mln, revised from 277 mln in December and 252 mln in January 1986.

Gold rose by about 50 U.S. Cents an ounce, following a statement by President Ronald Reagan that the arms-for-hostages deal with Iran "was a mistake," dealers said.     Bullion rose to 409.40/90 dlrs from an initial low of 408.90/409.40. This compares with the opening of 409.00/50 and New York's close of 410.00/50.     Dealers noted mild short-covering in the metal after some initial selling by local investors. Trading was fairly quiet this morning partly owed to the slow U.S. Dollar activities, they added.     However, Reagan's remarks had only a short-lived bullish impact on the gold price, which is now stabilising at 409.10/60 dlrs, dealers said.     On the local market, the metal traded in a narrow range of 3,800 and 3,805 H.K. Dlrs a tael against yesterday's 3,778 close.  REUTER &#3;

grain,wheat,ship	UNUSUALLY DRY WEATHER AFFECTS CHINA'S AGRICULTURE .  Abnormally warm and dry weather over most parts of China is seriously affecting crops, the New China News Agency said.     It said the drought has made rice planting difficult in eight provinces, including Guangxi, Sichuan and Hunan. Plant diseases and insect pests have increased in wheat-producing areas, it said.     The agency said some areas of Guangxi, Hubei, Shanxi and other provinces have been suffering a drought for more than seven months.     The agency said the dry weather had reduced the amount of water stored by more than 20 pct compared with last March, lowered the water level of many rivers, reduced hydroelectric power supplies and caused water shortages for industry and consumers.     The upper reaches of the Yangtze are at their lowest levels in a century, causing many ships to run aground and making harbour manoeuvres difficult, it said.     The drought has also increased the number of forest fires. More than 1,000 fires in southern China had destroyed 13,340 hectares of forest by mid-February, it said.  REUTER &#3;
ship	TAIWAN SHIPBUILDER LOOKS FOR JAPANESE VENTURES .  Taiwan's state-owned China Shipbuilding Corp (CSBC) plans to seek joint production agreements with Japan and further diversify into ship repairing to try to trim its debts, chairman Louis Lo said.     He told Reuters in an interview that CSBC's first joint production venture, to build two hulls for &lt;Onomichi Dockyard Co Ltd>, was a success. Talks on similar projects have been held with other Japanese firms, including Mitsubishi Heavy Industries Co Ltd &lt;MITH.T> and Ishikawajima-Harima Heavy Industries Co Ltd &lt;JIMA.T>, he said.     Lo said CSBC delivered the hulls of two 2,200-TEU (twenty foot equivalent unit) container ships this year to Onomichi, which would complete production.     "We expect the successful cooperation between us and Onomichi will pave the way for further cooperation with other Japanese shipbuilders in the future," Lo said.     He said Japanese firms would gain from the lower cost of shipbuilding in Taiwan while CSBC would benefit from Japanese technology and marketing. This would pose a challenge to competitors in Europe and South Korea.     Lo said CSBC has made losses of about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs since beginning operations in 1975. Its total debt now stands at about 500 mln dlrs, with annual interest payments of nearly three mln dlrs.     But he said the company, which is Taiwan's largest shipbuilder, still has full government support and had begun diversifying into ship repairing and manufacture of pipes and other machinery.     "We hope we can survive and prosper through diversification," he said.     Lo said income from ship repairing almost doubled to 20 mln U.S. Dlrs in the year ended June 1986 compared with the previous financial year. He estimated income would rise to more than 25 mln dlrs in 1986/87.     CSBC has orders to build 10 ships totalling 460,000 dead weight tons (dwt) this financial year, compared with 11 ships of 462,000 dwt in 1985/86, he said.     Lo said the prospects for shipbuilding were gloomy at least until 1991 due to overtonnage, but the outlook for ship repairing was bright.  REUTER &#3;

Japan Line's cumulative debt was 68.98 billion yen at the end of September, which exceeded shareholders' equities and reserves totalling 63.40 billion.     In December, Japan Line asked banks to shelve repayment of about 124 billion yen in outstanding loans and about 153 billion in loans to its subsidiaries.     Japan Line said then that the yen's steep rise and the world shipping recession had hit the company hard.     The Japanese daily Asahi Shimbun said today that IBJ and three other banks plan to abandon a total of 16 billion yen in loans to Japan Line and a group of creditor banks plans to buy seven billion yen of new Japan Line shares.

OPEC countries are all sticking firmly to official crude oil prices but the volatility of spot prices is likely to continue into the third quarter, Indonesian Minister of Mines and Energy Subroto told Reuters.     Subroto, attending a Pacific Energy Cooperation conference, blamed recent rapid spot price changes on unbalanced supply and demand. "If we stick to the production limitation, the third quarter will be in better balance."     He said the market is in a period of transition while the impact of OPEC's December agreement to cut output and fix prices at an average 18 dlrs a barrel is worked through.     Asked whether OPEC members of the Gulf Cooperation Council (GCC) had any concrete proposals to help Qatar sell its crude oil in the face of strong resistance to its official prices, Subroto said: "Apparently they have taken care of that."     "They (the GCC) meet very often among themselves. I think they'll help each other," he said.     Subroto said that as he was not a member of OPEC's Price Differentials Committee he did not know why the meeting had been postponed from its scheduled April 2 date.     "Maybe they find it is better not to have the meeting because ... Everyone is sticking to official prices," he said.  REUTER &#3;

It said a joint field survey late last month by the association, the Commerce Ministry and the Bank of Thailand indicated that paddy output in Thailand's northeast region is lower than expected because of a drought in several provinces.     The association said rice growing areas in Nakhon Ratchasima, Chaiyaphum, Khon Kaen and Mahasarakam were especially affected by low rainfalls in the second half of 1986.

earn	HK BANK EXPECTED TO POST 10 TO 13 PCT PROFIT RISE .  The Hongkong and Shanghai Banking Corp &lt;HKBH.HK> is likely to show a rise in profit of between 10 and 13 pct for 1986, reflecting stronger than expected loan growth, share analysts polled by Reuters said.     Their estimates of the bank's net earnings for last year ranged from 2.99 to 3.1 billion H.K. Dlrs. Results will be announced on Tuesday. The 1985 net profit was 2.72 billion.     They forecast a final dividend of 29 cents for a total of 42 cents for the year against 38 cents in 1985, adjusted for a one-for-five bonus issue.     Analysts said they expected the bank to recommend a bonus issue this year, probably one for three or one for five.     The bank's 61.5 pct subsidiary Hang Seng Bank Ltd &lt;HSGH.HK> is to report its 1986 results on Friday.     Analysts expect Hang Seng to announce net profit of more than one billion dlrs for the first time, an increase of 10 to 12 pct.     They expect Hang Seng to pay a final dividend of 1.37 dlrs for a total of 1.75 dlrs for the year against 1.60 in 1985.     Analysts said that while the use of undisclosed inner reserves by banks here makes forecasting very imprecise, Hongkong Bank benefited from the unexpected strength of the Hong Kong economy in 1986, when gross domestic product grew by nearly nine pct against an initial forecast of 4.5 pct.     "They benefited considerably from the pickup in loan demand, as their loan portfolio is well balanced," an analyst at Mansion House Securities (F.E.) Ltd said.     Government figures show that total loans and advances rose by 13.8 pct in 1986, compared with a 4.5 pct increase in 1985.     Loans to finance Hong Kong's visible trade, the mainstay of the local economy, rose by 15.1 pct against a decline of five pct in 1985.     Low interest rates also helped the bank. Interest received on loans was low, with the prime rate at 6.5 pct at end-1986, but interest paid on savings was two pct. Hongkong Bank and Hang Seng Bank control half of all deposits in the banking system, giving them access to a large base of low-cost funds.     The strength of the real-estate market was another major income source for the bank group. Loans to finance property development and instalment mortgages rose sharply.     "The Hongkong Bank group is still the leader in mortgage business despite tough competition from the Bank of China group and other foreign banks," one analyst said.     The high level of activity on the capital and equities markets in 1986 contributed to a sharp improvement in Hongkong Bank subsidiaries Wardley Ltd &lt;WAIA.HK> and &lt;James Capel and Co>, analysts said. "Wardley had a tremendous year acting as financial adviser and underwriter," an analyst said.     Wardley was underwriter for last year's billion-dlr flotation of &lt;Cathay Pacific Airways Ltd>, of which Hongkong Bank owned 30 pct at the time.     The bank's stake has since been cut to 16.4 pct in return for 1.57 billion dlrs. It also sold its entire 48.8 pct stake in &lt;South China Morning Post Ltd>, the larger of two English-language daily newspapers here, for 1.18 billion dlrs.     The proceeds will go to reserves for acquisitions and will not show up in the profit and loss accounts, analysts said.     Analysts said the bank had also been helped by a reduced need to write off bad debts. "The need for provisions was much lower than the year before," said Tony Measor of Hong Leong Securities Co Ltd. "Last year's profits should have been 2.8 to 2.9 billion dlrs if not for the huge provisions."     Former Hongkong Bank chairman Michael Sandberg said the bank wrote off hundreds of millions of dollars against its shipping exposure in 1985. Lesley Nickolds of County Securities Asia Ltd said she saw no major shipping writeoffs in 1986. She forecast profit of 2.99 billion dlrs.     The bank's Latin American exposure, mainly through its 51-pct owned Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM>, appears to have improved substantially, analysts said. Marine Midland's 1986 fourth-quarter loan-loss provisions fell to 44.1 mln U.S. Dlrs from 89.2 mln a year before. Its 1986 net profit rose to 145 mln U.S. Dlrs from 125 mln in 1985.  REUTER &#3;

money-fx,dlr,yen	NEW CURRENCY PROBLEM SEEN AMONG U.S, EUROPE, JAPAN .  The highly visible drama involving the yen's sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major European currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate distortions, Japanese and European research officials said.     The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters the currency movements of the past two years are also creating a fundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances.     Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan- European Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe.     In many ways, not least in terms of rare international cooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down the value of the dollar was a historic one.     But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not necessarily central significance, the officials said.     The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took place, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement simply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.     "You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now, and that was well before Plaza," he said.     On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at 263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was 242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the dollar trend has been down, down, down.     Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The European currencies are moving back up against the yen.     The close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen. This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.     Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of of sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.     Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms.     "The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important to them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is laying the golden egg," said de Hora.     The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year in Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.     The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than U.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance, and which will cause problems.     "This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But therefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge," said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. "If you want my objective view, I don't expect a drastic improvement in our trade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports, and this year we may have to do so again," he said.

money-supply	SPAIN RAISES BANKS' RESERVE REQUIREMENT .  The Bank of Spain said it raised the reserve requirement for banks and savings banks to 19 pct of deposits from 18 pct to drain excess liquidity which threatened money supply and inflation targets.     In a statement issued late last night, the central bank said the measure would take effect from March 13.     "In recent weeks, there has been excess liquidity in the Spanish economy which, if not controlled, would threaten the monetary and inflation targets set by the government," the statement said.     Banking sources said the measure would drain about 200 billion pesetas from the system. The maximum reserve requirement allowed by law is 20 pct.     The move follows a half-point increase yesterday in the Bank of Spain's key overnight call money rate, which now stands at 13.5 pct. At today's auction, however, the bank left the rate unchanged.     Spain's principal measure of money supply, the broad-based liquid assets in public hands (ALP), grew at annualised rate of 8.3 pct in January compared with 11.4 pct during the whole of 1986 and a target of eight pct for 1987.     Banking sources said that although the January money supply figures were good, compared with annualised rates of 13.9 pct in December and 10.2 pct in January 1986, ALP growth appeared to have accelerated in February, raising government concern.     Regarding inflation, recent figures have suggested that prices were under control.     Secretary of State for Trade, Miguel Angel Fernandez Ordonez, said this week that the annualised inflation rate for February, not yet officially announced, fell to 5.5 pct from six pct in January, compared with inflation of 8.3 pct during 1986 and a government target of five pct for this year.

The state-owned Minerals and Metals Trading Corp will send a team to Japan next week to negotiate an iron ore export contract for 1987/88 beginning April 1, trade sources said.     Japan, the biggest buyer of Indian iron ore with imports of around 23 mln tonnes a year, has asked India to reduce prices from the current average of 18 dlrs a tonne, the sources said.     "Japan has said it may be forced to reduce ore imports from India next year if New Delhi fails to reduce the price," one source said, but declined to give further details.  REUTER &#3;
reserves,trade	TAIWAN FOREIGN EXCHANGE RESERVES HIT NEW HIGH .  Taiwan's foreign exchange reserves hit a new high of more than 51 billion U.S. Dlrs on March 4, compared with 50 billion in mid-February and 25.1 billion a year earlier, the central bank said.     Bank governor Chang Chi-Cheng told reporters the increase came mainly from the bank's purchases of more than one billion U.S. Dlrs on the local interbank market between February 18 and March 4.     He said the rise showed signs of slowing, however, because Taiwan has liberalised import policy and expects its trade surplus to decline over the next few months as a result.     Chang declined to predict how high the reserves might rise, but local economists have forecast they will hit 60 billion U.S. Dlrs by the end of 1987.     In January, Taiwan reduced import tariffs of up to 50 pct on some 1,700 foreign products. It had been under growing U.S. Pressure to cut its 1986 record 13.6 billion dlr trade surplus with the U.S. Taiwan's 1985 surplus with the U.S. Was 10.2 billion, according to official statistics.     Wang Chang-Ming, Vice Chairman of the Council for Economic Planning and Development, told Reuters the government is planning another round of deep tariff cuts in the second half of this year.     The reserves could support imports of more than two years for Taiwan, compared with about three months for Japan and the U.S.  REUTER &#3;

A limited Belgian issue of silver Ecu coins with a face value of five Ecus will go on sale from March 23 at a price of 500 Belgian francs each, a Finance Ministry spokesman said.     Gold Ecu coins with a face value of 50 Ecus will be sold from the same day. The spokesman told Reuters the price for these would be fixed just before they go on sale but was likely to be between 8,500 and 9,000 francs.     At least two mln silver coins and several hundreds of thousands of the gold coins will be minted, he said. They will be sold both in Belgium and abroad.     The coins will be the first ever denominated in the Ecu, the "basket" comprised of the 12-nation European Community's currencies except the Spanish peseta and the Portuguese escudo.     The issue is being made to mark the 30th anniversary of the EC's founding Treaty of Rome this month. Finance Minister Mark Eyskens, who currently presides over the EC's council of economic and finance ministers, has called the issue a political act of symbolic value which aimed to make the Community's goal of monetary integration more concrete.     The coins will be legal tender in Belgium but most demand is expected to come from coin collectors.  REUTER &#3;

The Papua New Guinea Government will establish a public corporation to invest in resources projects, Minerals and Energy Minister John Kaputin said.     "We intend to provide a means through which less privileged individuals can become part owners and beneficiaries from the development of mining and petroleum projects," he told Parliament.     Existing policy allowing the state up to 30 pct equity in major mining projects and 22.5 pct in oil and gas projects would be maintained, he said. The planned agency could take over the state's equity in current developments.     Kaputin said Papua New Guinea was experiencing a boom with exploration companies spending about 60 mln kina annually on about 150 mining and 23 petroleum projects.     "The Government is determined to ensure that Papua New Guinean ownership in minerals and petroleum projects increases in an orderly way," he said.     Kaputin did not say when the corporation would be established or exactly what form it would take, but said the government would study whether it should be directly involved in exploration or development.

The Nigerian naira firmed 2.6 pct against the dollar after 17 banks were disqualified from bidding at today's weekly foreign exchange auction, the central bank said. The naira finished at 3.8050 to the dollar, against 3.9050 last week.     Only 38.39 mln dlrs of the 50 mln dlrs on offer was sold, with all 27 bidding banks successfully obtaining hard currency.     The effective rate, including a central bank levy, for transactions in the coming week, was 3.8241 against 3.9246 last week.     The failure to sell the whole allocation was due to the central bank's unprecedented disqualification of 17 banks as punishment for inadequate documentation in previous transactions.     Banks are required to submit proof that their bids are based on valid commercial transactions and the central bank has complained in the past that many are failing to produce the right paperwork within the specified time.

U.S. Undersecretary of State for Economic Affairs Allen Wallis said he had urged Japan to do much more to reduce its large trade surplus with the United States.     "Our central message to Japan this week was that while we have made progress in some areas, much needs to be done," he told a press conference after three days of talks.     "What we need is a resolution of trade issues, we need visible efforts to restructure the economy to encourage more imports and we need greater domestic-led growth."     Forecasting sluggish economic growth in Japan this year, Wallis urged Tokyo to stimulate domestic demand to help reduce its trade surplus, which hit a record 83 billion dlrs in 1986.     He named several areas of particular concern to Washington -- computer microchips, supercomputers, Kansai airport, agricultural products and car telephones.     He warned that the U.S./Japan agreement governing trade in semiconductors was in jeopardy. Despite the pact, Japanese producers are still dumping microchips in foreign markets other than the United States while U.S. Penetration of the Japanese market has not increased, he said.

gnp	GERMAN ECONOMIC OUTLOOK SEEN FAIRLY BRIGHT .  The outlook for the West German economy is relatively bright, with gross national product expected to expand by three pct this year, Kiel University's Institute for World Economy said.     The GNP forecast by the institute, one of five leading economic research bodies in West Germany, is more optimistic than that of the other institutes, some of which have recently reduced their GNP forecasts to between two and 2.5 pct.     In a report the Kiel institute said West Germany's export outlook has not deteriorated fundamentally despite the mark's strength against the dollar and other major currencies.     "The danger that exports will slump in 1987 appears, all in all, limited," the report said. "On the contrary, a slight rise in exports can be expected."     The institute said past experience has shown West German exporters will move to counterbalance currency factors by cutting costs, trying to penetrate new markets and adjusting their product ranges.     They will be aided in 1987 by an expected slight rise in economic growth in industrial countries. At the same time, the decline in exports to oil producing countries looks set to slow this year.     West German GNP growth in 1987 will be led by renewed advances in domestic consumption and investment spending, both of which will in turn be buoyed by an expansionary monetary policy, the institute said.     However, it said the labour market would see only a slight improvement because companies will be reluctant to hire additional workers due to higher labour costs caused partly by agreed reductions in working hours.     The institute cautioned that the expansionary stance of monetary policy in West Germany was likely to bring a marked acceleration of inflation.     It also warned that what it called the worldwide synchronization of monetary policy heightened the risk of a new global recession. It said central banks in industrialized countries, including the Bundesbank, had followed the Federal Reserve Board's expansionary course.     The institute said this in turn was bound to lead eventually to a rise in worldwide inflation and a shift in U.S. Policy towards a more restrictive policy. Other central banks were likely to follow suit, causing a recession that could aggravate the debt crisis of developing countries as well as increase protectionism around the world.     Although Germany cannot entirely shield itself from the negative effects of the global synchronization of monetary policy, it should do all it can to strengthen the forces of growth at home.     The institute said this could be done by ensuring that fiscal policy fosters a willingness to work and invest. Taxes should be cut by a greater amount than currently planned, and wage increases in 1987 and 1988 should be markedly lower than in 1986. It also said the Bundesbank should reduce inflationary pressures by cutting the current rate of growth in money supply to about four pct.  REUTER &#3;

At least one company has expressed interest and negotiations are not yet over, banking sources said.     However, the banks are now prepared to consider taking the stake if they find an investor willing to inject six to seven mln dlrs in the company but not take control, the banking sources said.

trade	ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - POLISH SANCTIONS .  Poland says U.S. Sanctions have cost its economy 15 billion dlrs and has made clear it wants Washington to take a lead in repairing the damage after lifting remaining restrictions two weeks ago.     Polish officials are unable to provide a precise breakdown of the figure, saying it takes into account a number of hypothetical losses. Some of them are "too sophisticated to convert into financial terms," one banking source said.     But Western economic experts say the effect of sanctions is impossible to calculate.     They say it is blurred by the poor performance of Poland's economy, and dismiss the 15 billion dlr figure as illusory.     "Sanctions have provided a very useful excuse for under- achieving. They did have a bad effect, yes, but they only contributed to largely internal, economic problems," one said.     The U.S. Imposed the measures and withdrew Most Favoured Nation (MFN) trading status from Poland in 1982 in retaliation for suppression of the Solidarity free trade union under martial law. The estimated cost to the Polish economy was originally devised several years ago by the Institute of National Economy, an offshoot of the central planning commission.     According to one Western envoy, an expert on Polish economic affairs, it extrapolated 1979 information on growth trends in trade with the United States, as well as increases in credits from Western commercial and government lenders.     But the calculations were based on a time when trade was booming and credits still flowed freely, he said, dismissing the estimate as "a theoretical projection based on a high point, which has no real scientific evaluation."     A foreign trade ministry official said Polish exports to the U.S. In the late 1970s averaged around 400 mln dlrs annually and had fallen by half since the sanctions were imposed.     Imports have suffered, slumping from around 800 mln dlrs to 200 mln, as credits ran out. Poland has a dwindling trade surplus with the West. Last year it was one billion dlrs against a targeted 1.6 billion, official figures show.     Acknowledging that sanctions have lost Poland important U.S. Markets -- including agricultural equipment, textiles, chemicals and some foodstuffs -- Western economists say credits dried up for economic not political reasons.  "Poland is accusing the West of letting economic relations deteriorate for political reasons," said one expert. "It's an illusion based on a misunderstanding of Western economy."     "There's a limit to how much you can go on giving someone who has no hope of repaying it," another said, adding that Poland had benefited from a global phenomenon of easy credits in the 1970s which were no longer today's reality.     Describing the 15 billion dlr assessment as "nebulous," one diplomat said it also included losses of hypothetical orders and setbacks to Polish research through the curbing of scientific links and exchanges.  Western officials say the lifting of sanctions and new MFN status will have little impact on Poland, which has a hard currency debt of 33.5 billion dlrs and lacks the means to modernise its industry.     "MFN doesn't really mean anything, only that Poland will not be treated worse than other countries. It will be difficult to regain access to the U.S. Market because different forces are in play now," said one Western envoy.     He said Polish products were not competitive, and their quality was too low. Trade wars and possible protectionist measures amongst the U.S., Japan and Europe would also hamper Poland's efforts to regain entry.     Deputy foreign trade minister Janusz Kaczurba recognised this fact recently.     Kaczurba told the official PAP news agency recently, "Making up our lost position will take a long time and be uncommonly difficult, and in certain cases impossible... In a period of two to three years it will be possible to increase the level of exports by only about 100 mln dlrs."     While Poland is unlikely to seek compensation, it says it has a "moral right" to assistance from the U.S. Which it says imposed the sanctions illegally. But a Western economist said "The argument that U.S. Sanctions were a unilateral torpedoing of the Polish economy won't cut any ice. The Americans will just reply that the Poles acted immorally in crushing Solidarity."     Nevertheless, Polish National Bank head Wladyslaw Baka, in talks in Washington last week with the International Monetary Fund (IMF) and World Bank, made it clear that Poland was looking for a lead from the United States.     He was quoted by PAP as saying that Poland would meet its financial obligations to the United States, "but not in a short time and not without a cooperative stand on the part of its foreign economic partners."     He stressed that the U.S. "had a particular opportunity to play a part in the cooperative policy of Poland's partners interested in the settlement of Polish debt."     Putting it more sharply, one senior banking official blamed Washington for obstructing talks with the World Bank, IMF and Paris Club of Western creditor governments in recent years and said it should now play a more positive role.     "As a major superpower the United States can influence international organisations," he said, citing recent meetings aimed at stabilising currencies as an example of the extent to which Western nations were prepared to cooperate.

Britain had a visible trade deficit of 2.6 billion stg in the fourth quarter of 1986 against a revised deficit of 2.9 billion in the third quarter, official statistics show.     Seasonally-adjusted figures issued by the Central Statistical Office (CSO) show the current account was in deficit by 760 mln stg against an upwardly revised third quarter shortfall of 930 mln.     For 1986 as a whole, visible trade was in deficit by 8.3 billion stg, sharply up from 1985's 2.2. Billion shortfall and a 4.4 billion deficit in 1984.     Preliminary figures for invisible transactions in the fourth quarter show a surplus 1.8 billion stg to give an estimated surplus for 1986 of 7.2 billion. The fourth quarter figure was in line with CSO projections released on Friday.     The third quarter invisibles surplus was revised down to 1.9 billion stg from 2.25 billion.     In 1985 the invisibles surplus was 5.1 billion stg.     The reduced deficit on visible trade in the fourth quarter was due to an increase in the surplus on oil of 200 mln stg and a reduction in the non-oil trade deficit of 100 mln, the CSO said.     However, 1986's surplus on oil trade was 4.0 billion stg lower than in 1985, while the deficit on non-oil trade increased by 2.1 billion.     The figures were broadly in line with market expectations.     The CSO stressed that figures for invisible transactions, particularly for the most recent quarters are liable to substantial revisions as later information becomes available.  REUTER &#3;

money-fx,interest	FRENCH INTERVENTION RATE CUT LIKELY, DEALERS SAY .  The Bank of France is likely to cut its money market intervention rate by up to a quarter point at the start of next week.  This follows a steady decline in the call money rate over the past 10 days and signals from the Finance Ministry that the time is ripe for a fall, dealers said.     The call money rate peaked at just above nine pct ahead of the meeting of finance ministers from the Group of Five industrial countries and Canada on February 22, which restored considerable stability to foreign exchanges after several weeks of turbulence.     The call money rate dropped to around 8-3/8 pct on February 23, the day after the Paris accord, and then edged steadily down to eight pct on February 27 and 7-3/4 pct on March 3, where it has now stabilised.     Dealers said the Bank of France intervened to absorb liquidity to hold the rate at 7-3/4 pct.     While call money has dropped by well over a percentage point, the Bank of France's money market intervention rate has remained unchanged since January 2, when it was raised to eight pct from 7-1/4 pct in a bid to stop a franc slide.     The seven-day repurchase rate has also been unchanged at 8-3/4 since it was raised by a half-point on January 5.     The Bank of France has begun using the seven-day repurchase rate to set an upper indicator for money market rates, while using the intervention rate to set the floor.     Sources close to Finance Minister Edouard Balladur said that he would be happy to see an interest rate cut, and dealers said any fall in the intervention rate was most likely to come when the Bank of France buys first category paper next Monday, although an earlier cut could not be excluded.    A cut in the seven-day repurchase rate could come as early as tomorrow morning, banking sources said.     They said recent high interest rates have encouraged an acceleration in foreign funds returning to France, discouraging the authorities from making a hasty rate cut. But they also pointed out that money supply is broadly back on target, giving scope for a small fall in rates.     M-3 money supply, the government's key aggregate, finished 1986 within the government's three to five pct growth target, rising 4.6 pct compared with seven pct in 1985.  REUTER &#3;

crude	EARLY MARCH OPEC OUTPUT SEEN WELL BELOW CEILING .  OPEC crude oil output in the first few days of March was running at about 14.7 mln bpd, down from a 16 mln bpd average for February and well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling the group adopted in December, a Reuter survey shows.     The figures were polled by Reuters correspondents from oil traders, industry executives and analysts in Europe, the Middle East, Africa, Latin America and Asia.     They back recent statements by OPEC ministers that the group is producing within its ceiling to support the return to a fixed price system, which came into effect last month.     OPEC output for the whole of February was about 200,000 bpd above the ceiling, largely because of overproduction by the United Arab Emirates and Kuwait, the figures show.     The UAE, together with the much smaller producer Ecuador, was also producing above quota in the first days of March, the survey reveals.     But such overproduction was compensated for by a sharp fall in Saudi Arabian output, together with Iran"s inability to export as much as its quota allows.     Iraq rejected its OPEC quota of 1.466 mln bpd and produced 1.75 mln bpd in February and early March, the figures showed.     Saudi output -- excluding movements into stocks -- fell to 3.1 mln bpd in early March from 3.5 mln bpd in February, against a 4.133 mln bpd quota. The Saudi figures include a 200,000 bpd share of Neutral Zone production.     Kuwait, which has consistently denied quota violations, was estimated to be pumping 1.4 mln bpd in February and 1.15 in early March -- both figures including 200,000 bpd as its share of Neutral Zone output -- against its 948,000 bpd quota.     Reports of customer resistance to fixed prices set by some OPEC states were reflected in output from Qatar and Nigeria, both substantially under quota in February and early March.     Qatar's February output was 230,000 bpd, and this fell to 180,000 bpd in early March compared with its 285,000 bpd quota.     Industry sources say Japanese buyers are resisting Qatar"s prices and Gulf Arab oil states have pledged to make up for any shortfall in sales which a fellow Gulf state suffers.

acq	BAKER &lt;BKO> SUES TO FORCE HUGHES &lt;HT> MERGER .  Baker International corp said it has filed suit in state court in Houston to compel Hughes Tool Co to complete its proposed merger with Baker.     Late yesterday, Hughes said it had terminated the merger agreement because Baker would not agree to an alternative divestiture plan devised by Hughes.  Hughes' board had previously found unacceptable a U.S. Justice Department consent decree that would have required broader divestitures.     Baker said it has not obtained any satisfactory explanation from Hughes of its objections to the provisions of the Justice Department consent decree.     Hughes yesterday adjourned the special meeting at which shareholders were to vote on the merger without permitting the counting of votes on the deal.  Baker said it believes the vote was overwhelmingly in favor of the merger.     Baker said the new terms that Hughes proposed for the merger, as an alternative to the consent decree, were "more burdensome" than those of the consent decree themselves.     Baker said divestitures under the consent decree would reduce revenues for the combined company by about 65 mln dlrs or three pct.     Baker said it will continue to pursue the divestitures of the units named in the consent decree.     It said its suit names as defendants Hughes and certain of its directors and seeks either an injunction forcing Hughes to live up to the merger agreement or "substantial" monetary damages it did not name.     Baker said it believes the merger to be in the best interests of shareholders of both companies.  Reuter &#3;
interest	SPAIN DEREGULATES BANK DEPOSIT INTEREST RATES .  Spain's Finance Ministry deregulated bank deposit rates in an effort to raise competition among banks and bring legislation into line with the European Community (EC), a ministry spokesman said.     The measure was published today in the Official State Gazette. It takes effect tomorrow and lifts restrictions on rates, now limited to six pct on deposits of up to 180 days.     The government also enacted a decree cutting to one pct from 13 pct the proportion of total assets which banks must lend at favourable rates to industries classified "of public interest."     Some bankers expect the deregulation of rates to result in a 20 pct drop in profits this year.     Secretary of State for the Economy Guillermo de la Dehesa told Reuters in a recent interview the reduction in fixed asset investments would offset losses from the rate liberalisation.  REUTER &#3;
acq	USAIR &lt;U> REJECTS TWA &lt;TWA> TAKEOVER BID .  USAir Group Inc said its board has rejected Trans World Airlines Inc's offer to acquire USAir for 52 dlrs per share in cash as grossly in adequate and not in the best interests of USAir shareholders, employees or passengers.     The company said the unsolicited bid by the Carl C. Icahn-led TWA was "highly conditional."     USAir said its board and that of Piedmont Aviation Inc &lt;PIE> met separately yesterday to consider USAir's offer to acquire 50.1 pct of Piedmont for 71 dlrs per share and remaining shares for 1.5 to 1.9 common shares each, valued at about 73 dlrs per share based on the average closing price of USAir common during a period just before the merger.     The company said it is continuing talks with Piedmont on arriving at a definitive merger agreement and the two companies hope to reach one very shortly.     USAir said "In light of the highly conditional nature and other terms of the TWA offer, the timing of the offer and the circumstances under which it was made, USAir Group believes that the purpose of the TWA offer is to interfere with USAir Group's proposed acquisition of Piedmont.     "TWA's proposal is nothing more than an attempt by Carl Icahn to disrupt at the eleventh hour USAir Group's acquisition of Piedmont, a transaction which the USAir Group board views as most beneficial to USAir Group shareholders, employees and passengers and which Mr. Icahn obviously regards as contrary to his own personal interests."     USAir said its board has authorized counsel to explore all appropriate legal remedies against what it called TWA's last-minute attempt to interfere with USAir Group's acquisition of Piedmont.     The company said conditions to the TWA offer include TWA obtaining financing, the USAir board redeeming defensive rights issued to shareholders last year and acting to render the "fair price" provision contained in USAir's charter inapplicable to the TWA offer and Transportation Department approval.

earn	JAGUAR SEES STRONG GROWTH IN NEW MODEL SALES .  Jaguar Plc &lt;JAGR.L> is about to sell its new XJ-6 model on the U.S. And Japanese markets and expects a strong reception based on its success in the U.K., Chairman Sir John Egan told a news conference.     Commenting on an 11 pct growth in 1986 group turnover to 830.4 mln stg and pre-tax profits at 120.8 mln stg, slightly below 1985's 121.3 mln, Egan said Jaguar aimed at an average profit growth of 15 pct per year. However, the introduction of the new model had kept this year's pre-tax profit down.     Jaguar starts selling XJ-6 in the U.S. In May and plans to sell 25,000 of its total 47,000 production there in 1987.     U.S. Sales now account for 65 pct of total turnover, finance director John Edwards said.     A U.S. Price for the car has not been set yet, but Edwards said the relatively high car prices in dollars of West German competitors offered an "umbrella" for Jaguar. He added the XJ-6 had also to compete with U.S. Luxury car producers which would restrict the car's price.     Jaguar hedges a majority of its dollar receipts on a 12-month rolling basis and plans to do so for a larger part of its receipts for longer periods, John Egan said.     In the longer term, capital expenditure will amount to 10 pct of net sales. Research and development will cost four pct of net sales and training two pct.     Jaguar builds half of its cars and buys components for the other half. The firm is in early stages of considering the building of an own press shop in Britain for about 80 mln stg, but Egan said this would take at least another three years     On the London Stock Exchange, Jaguar's shares were last quoted at 591p, down from 611p at yesterday's close, after reporting 1986 results which were in line with market expectations, dealers said.

Responsibility for the appreciation of the Taiwan dollar and the South Korean Won lies soley with those countries, said U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter     Speaking to the Asia Society, Yeutter said that it is in those countries' own long-term interest to raise the value of their currencies against the dollar.     Yeutter was responding to a question about what the U.S. could do to encourage appreciation of those currencies against the dollar in order to reduce the large U.S. trade deficits with Taiwain and Korea.     "An undervalued currency will help those countries' exports in the short term, but in the long run they have to be concerned about how they are perceived in the international business community," Yeutter said.     For Taiwan, Yeutter said that with its per capita trade surplus with the U.S., much larger than that of Japan's, and with huge foreign exchange reserves, it was difficult to defend the high import tarrifs and other barriers that prevail in that country.     He also said that the south Korean Won should begin to move to reflect underlying economic fundamentals, "otherwise in two or three years' time, Korea will be in the same situation that prevails in Taiwan."     Turning to the U.S. deficit with Japan of more than 50 billion dlrs, Yeutter said that this situation was not sustainable.     "Something must give soon. If not, there is a great threat of U.S. legislative action to counteract that trend," Yeutter said.  Reuter &#3;

The Shell Oil dollar net income fell 47 pct in the year, while the additional effect of currency movements reduced the contribution to group net income by 57 pct to 472 mln stg.     The group earlier reported a drop in net income for the year to 2.54 billion stg from 3.03 billion previously, with lower crude prices outweighing the effect of increased sales by volume.     Although the figures were lower, they were nonetheless at the top end of market forecasts. Shell Transport and Trading Plc &lt;SC.L> shares, the U.K. Arm of the group, rose to 11.39 stg from a close last night of 11.06 stg. Analysts noted that a general collapse in exploration and production volumes was partially offset by earnings from chemicals rising to 462 mln stg from 205 mln in 1985.     Also, a windfall tax credit and lower than expected currency losses had added about 100 mln stg onto fourth quarter results, which was the main reason for the figures exceeding forecasts, industry analyst Chris Rowland of Barclays de Zoete Wedd noted.     However, he added there could well be a sharp fall in performance in the first quarter of 1987, due to the improbability that the group would be able to repeat the high refining and marketing margins of first quarter 1986.     The impact of recovering oil prices would come through faster on the downstream side than on the upstream as such a high proportion of upstream activity centred on gas, which typically reacted to oil price changes with about a half-year lag, analysts said.     Holmes said that in the upstream U.S. Sector the third quarter of 1986 had been the worst of all.     Only two of the oil majors had managed to make a profit in the period, with Shell Oil being one of them. The decrease in U.S. Earnings had been accentuated by tax rates but the group had increased share to become volume market leader, Holmes added.     Continued low crude oil prices would continue to subdue U.S. Exploration activity. "Exploration is currently pretty flat. We are going to go on, but at 16-18 dlrs there will be no massive upturn," he said.     A renewal of exploration in high cost areas of the North Sea and the U.S. Requires prices of around 25 dlrs a barrel.     Ultimately this would lead to a rise in U.S. Imports. "If you are not exploring you are not going to find anything," he noted.     U.S. Oil production had dropped some half mln barrels a day (bbd) in 1986 and would continue to fall if the price stayed below 20 dlrs a barrel.     This favored OPEC's attempts to stabilise prices, as the lower the price the more likelihood there was of non-OPEC marginal production shutting down. "OPEC has done pretty extraordinarily well...Everything is moving in (its) direction," he added.  Reuter &#3;
interest	BANKERS WELCOME SPANISH RESERVE REQUIREMENT HIKE .  Bankers welcomed the Bank of Spain's decision to raise the reserve requirement for banks and savings banks, saying it reflected the socialist government's determination not to ease up in the fight against inflation despite the painful social effects of four years of austerity.     The central bank last night raised the requirement by one percentage point to 19 pct from March 13, saying that excess liquidity threatened money supply and inflation targets.     Bankers said the move represented a change of tactic by the Bank, which until now has relied on raising interest rates to choke off money supply growth.     "I think it's a good measure," a senior foreign banker said. "It's a faster way to get the job done than using interest rates and avoids unpleasant effects on other areas of the economy."     "It shows that the political will is very strong. They know that controlling inflation will make industry more competitive and bring down unemployment in the long run," he added.     The head of another foreign bank said that only a month ago, the Bank of Spain had dismissed his suggestion of a rise in reserve requirements, preferring to pursue its strategy of raising interest rates.     But bankers said the high real interest rates on offer now -- around eight pct for overnight funds -- was attracting money from abroad, strengthening the peseta and making Spanish exports less competitive.     The government says industry's competitiveness is also being hit hard by inflation. At 8.3 pct last year, the rate was way above that of Spain's major trading partners in the European Community, which it joined a year ago.     To help meet this year's target of five pct, it is insisting pay rises stay at that level, setting the stage for clashes with trade unions, who say they have made enough sacrifices.     Demonstrations by workers, students and farmers, whose demands essentially involve more government spending, have become an almost daily occurrence. But Prime Minister Felipe Gonzalez insists that the state is doing as much as it can.     Bankers said the reserve requirement increase could have some impact on commercial lending rates but should not hit the money market too hard.     The Bank of Spain, which only yesterday raised its key overnight call money rate to 13.5 pct, left it unchanged at today's auction. The rate has been increased nine times since the start of the year, when it was below 12 pct.     Bankers said commercial lending rates were set to rise in any case with the end of the six pct maximium interest rate banks can offer for time deposits of up to six months.     The measure will take effect tomorrow, following the publication of the decree in today's official gazette. Bankers say the liberalisation will increase the cost of funds and, inevitably, push lending rates higher.     A companion measure, reducing the proportion of funds which banks must invest in specific areas, also takes effect tomorrow. Officials said when the cut was approved last month that it was aimed partly at compensating banks for higher interest rates.  REUTER &#3;

Western Canada's resource-based economy is being hurt by international market forces and there is little Ottawa can do about it, Finance Minister Michael Wilson said.     "If you can tell me how we can get the international energy price up and how we can get the price for copper up and how we can get the price for wheat up, then we will listen," Wilson told the House of Comnons Finance Committee.     Although under pressure from oil companies and wheat farmers for help in battling depressed commodity prices, Wilson said it has to be recognized the area was a "prisoner of market forces outside the boundaries of this country."     Wilson, appearing before the committee to discuss the government's spending estimates released earlier this week, said the government is doing what it can in the region, citing more than 3.5 billion dlrs in aid for western agriculture.     "Those resources are a reflection of very real concerns on our part in dealing with a very difficult problem," Wilson said in response to questions about management of the economy from opposition party members.     He said the long term answer for depressed regions of the country was reaching a free trade pact with the United States, which he claimed would improve the outlook for Western Canada.  Reuter &#3;

oilseed,soybean	SOYBEAN GROUP HEAD URGES USDA ACTION ON LOAN .  The Agriculture Department must make a decision soon on how to change the current U.S. soybean loan or more soybeans will continue to be forfeited to the government and foreign soybean production will increase, the president of the American Soybean Association, ASA, said.     "The USDA will have to bite the bullet one way or another ... USDA can dodge and dart around it (the soybean loan) as much as they want, but they have to eventually address this problem," David Haggard, ASA president, told Reuters.     USDA is not offering any new soybean loan options, and Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng has not consulted ASA on the soybean loan, Haggard said.     "I don't know if USDA is really very serious about addressing the soybean loan problem," he said.     At ASA's annual winter board of directors meeting here, ASA leaders refused to change their official position on the  loan -- still calling for income support at 5.02 dlrs.     The association backs current bills of Rep. Bill Emerson, R-Mo. and Sen. Thad Cochran, R-Miss., which call for either a 5.02 marketing loan or a producer option payment.     Haggard said he does not know what chances the ASA-backed proposals have but said, "in all honesty, we do not want to see the farm bill be torn apart."     He said if USDA feels it cannot withdraw its opposition to a market loan, there are still numerous ways the USDA could change the loan without new legislation.     Making the loan partially in certificates which would not have to be paid back would be one option, he said.  Reuter &#3;

reserves	FRENCH OFFICIAL RESERVES FALL SHARPLY IN JANUARY .  French official reserves fell 45.06 billion francs to 375.95 billion at the end of January from 421.00 billion at the end of December, the Finance Ministry said in a statement.     It said the fall was largely due to sales of foreign currency that preceded the January 11 realignment of the European Monetary System (EMS).     Foreign currency reserves fell by 8.91 billion francs during the month, the ministry said.     This reflected outflows of 10.26 billion francs through operations of the French exchange stabilisation fund, counterbalanced by a gain of 1.35 billion francs resulting from the quarterly adjustment in the value of dollar deposits held with the European Monetary Cooperation Fund (FECOM).     But most of the decline reflected a 33.90 billion franc deficit that France built up during the month with FECOM as a result of using very short-term financing instruments.     The Bank of France, in conjunction with the Bundesbank and other central banks, intervened heavily in foreign exchange markets between late December and the January 11 EMS accord, in an attempt to hold down the mark, which was attracting a flight of funds from the dollar, and simultaneously shore up the franc.     On January 11, the mark was revalued by three pct against the French franc, relieving pressure on the French currency.     The fall in foreign exchange reserves took these reserves to 98.83 billion francs at the end of January from 107.74 billion at end December.     Gold reserves were unchanged at 218.45 billion francs.     Reserves of European Currency Units fell to 73.25 billion francs from 75.27 billion at end December.

coffee	BRAZIL HAS NO SET COFFEE EXPORT TARGETS - IBC .  Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following this week's breakdown of International Coffee Organization talks on export quotas, President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, IBC, Jorio Dauster said.     He told a press conference Brazil now had to reconsider its export plans and that the 15.5 mln bag export figure which it had proposed for itself earlier should no longer be taken as the country's export target to ICO-member countries.     The 15.5 mln bag offer had been made on the assumption an agreement would bring stability to world markets, he added.     It had been a gesture to ease negotiations, but the lack of an agreement leaves it no longer valid and exports could be above or below 15.5 mln bags, he said.     Dauster said he would talk to producers, exporters and market analysts before taking any decision on export policy, but any future policy would be flexible and adjusted to market conditions.     "We will not take any short-term decisions which might cause markets to panic," Dauster added.     He said it would be a policy which shows Brazil has coffee to sell and that it could do so without an ICO agreement.     "Brazil has coffee (to sell) and wants to show that it does not need an ICO agreement as a crutch," Dauster said.     Commenting on the breakdown of the talks, Dauster said consumer proposals would have implied a reduction of one to two mln bags in Brazil's export quotas.     "It was a proposal which would lead to a substantial loss for Brazil and which would be difficult for the country to recover," he said.     The consumer proposal to base quotas on a six-year moving average of exportable production surpluses would lead to overproduction as countries boosted output to win higher quotas, he said.     Dauster rejected reports which said Brazil's inflexibility had been the cause for the breakdown of talks, noting that its stance had the backing of 85 pct of producing countries.     Close links would continue with these producers, particularly Colombia, Mexico and Francophone African countries, but Dauster said no joint marketing action was envisaged at present.     He also said Brazil currently had no plans to return to a system of roaster buying contracts, although "no hypothesis has been abandoned."     Dauster said he had not yet decided when registrations for May shipment coffee will be opened.     He declined comment on whether the IBC will adopt a policy of opening registrations for up to six months in advance, as some exporters had suggested.     He noted export registrations for the first four months of the year totalled around 5.5 mln bags, more than half the 9.9 mln exported in 1986 when drought reduced the crop to between 11.2 mln and 12 mln bags.     He said that, although he had heard forecasts of 30 mln bags for the coming crop, the IBC would not make any estimate until late April.  Reuter &#3;

acq	SHAD SEES PROGRESS ON INSIDER TRADING .  Securities and Exchange Commission chairman John Shad said progress was being made in stopping insider trading, but the chairman of a House subcommittee with jurisdiction over securities laws said he was concerned about conditions on Wall Street.     "Greed has created a feeding frenzy on Wall Street and in the process laws are broken and multi-billion dlr corporations have become easy prey," Rep. Edward Markey, D-Mass, the chairman of the Telecommunications and Finance said at the start of a hearing on SEC activities.     "Congress is understandably nervous. We perceive the current scandals as a warning of even worse things to come," Markey said. "The frenzy and disruption created by merger mania is particularly distressing."     Shad said the recent cases involving Ivan Boesky, Dennis Levine and others was a warning that those who engage in insider trading were taking a heavy risk of imprisonment, high fines and disbarment from the securities industry.     "Insider trading has not been eradicated, but it has been inhibited and multimillions of dollars of profits that Boesky and others have been siphoning off the markets are now flowing through to legitimate investors and traders," Shad said in his statement.     Shad said insider trading cases involved only 10 pct or less of SEC enforcement actions in recent years but they have increased significantly to 125 cases brought during the past five years compared to 77 cases in the preceeding 47 years.     Markey said he did not favor banning takeovers but thought the tender offer process needed reform including earlier disclosure of takeover attempts.     N.J. Rep. Mathew Rinaldo, the senior subcommittee Republican, said he was introducing legislation to create a five member commission to study the securities industry for a year and report its findings and recommendations to Congress. Commission members would be appointed by the SEC.     "Its primary mission would be to analyze the extent of illegal trading on insider trading and to assess the adequacy of existing surveillance systems and government oversight operations. The commission would advise Congress as to what additional resources or civil or criminal remedies are needed to combat fraud and improve compliance with federal laws," Rinaldo said.  Reuter &#3;
crude	OPEC SAYS FEBRUARY OUTPUT UNDER CEILING .  OPEC output in February was "well below" the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in December and all countries are strictly adhering to their quotas, the OPEC news agency Opecna quoted an OPEC secretariat official as saying.     The official was quoted as saying that lower output was the result "of member countries' firm determination to defend the organisation's official price of 18 dlrs per barrel, and to refrain from selling any quantity below that price."     The unnamed official was further quoted as saying that no OPEC meeting was foreseen before the next biannual OPEC session planned to start on June 25.     The official gave no figure for February output. The statement said only that "the reduction in total supplies, namely actual exports of crude oil and products, plus local deliveries in member countries, is even more pronounced as those supplies fell very noticeably during that month."     "No matter what the pressure on member countries by lifters to align the official selling price to the ongoing market price, member countries are, without exception, strictly adhering to the official selling price in spite of the financial hardship this may entail," the statement said.     "The very recent improvement in the price structure is an indicator of such determination by the organization to stick to the official selling price," the statement said.     Free spot market prices rose from around 14.50 dlrs a barrel in early December last year to near OPEC's official levels towards the end of the year, after the OPEC pact.     There has been oil industry speculation that OPEC might have to hold an extraordinrary meeting prior to its scheduled June session to discuss reports of overproduction by some states and strains on the differential matrix, which prices each OPEC crude according to its quality and distance from main markets.     The official said in the statement that no such emergency session was scheduled "because of member countries' firm determination to defend the price (system)" agreed in December.     Opec"s differential committee was to have met in Vienna starting April 2 but this session has been postponed, with no new date set, according to an official of the United Arab Emirates, which chairs the seven-state body.

The department said the acquisition is not likely to substantially lessen competition and would not harm the public interest.     The department had given its tentative approval of the acquisition in January.     The department said it decided to make final its tentative decision after reviewing the public response to it.     The agency said it rejected an assertion by Air North America, which currently is not operating but plans to start service to some of the cities served by USAIR and PSA, that the acquisition would lessen chances of new entry into those markets by other carriers.     The agency said Air North America provided no support for its claim that the transaction would give the two carriers monopoly power in some markets.     The transportation agency said Air North America also failed to show that there are barriers that would prevent new entrants into those markets or prevent other carriers from increasing their service.     The agency noted in its final order that PSA operates exclusively in the West and Mexico while USAir serves the West for the most part with some long-haul flights from the East and Midwest.     The two carriers serve five point in common; Los Angeles, San Diego, San Francico, Phoenix and Tucsonm, the agency said.      The transportation department also rejected a request by the Teamsters Union, which represents some PSA workers, to require protections for PSA workers.     The agency noted that USAir has promised to give protective benefits to PSA workers and that unions representing PSA workers have collective bargaining agreements that provide such protections.

livestock	ANTIBIOTICS IN FEED AID DEADLY BACTERIA: STUDY .  A study of salmonella poisoning has uncovered new evidence that the common practice of feeding antibiotics to cattle is helping to create deadly bacteria that can infect humans and resist medicines.     Researchers at the federal Centers for Disease Control tracked the spread of an unusual strain of salmonella that is resistant to the drug chloramphenicol and were able to link the resulting food poisoning to farms that used the drug to promote the growth of cattle.     Cattlemen often give their animals a constant supply of antibiotics in feed to help them grow faster. But critics have been warning for years that the constant exposure to the drugs is helping bacteria learn to resist the drugs.     Industry officials have disputed this, saying the diseases that develop a resistance in cattle probably do not affect humans.     But the new study, reported in Thursday's New England Journal of Medicine, shows the diseases can spread to humans.     The research team, led by Dr. John Spika, said the number of people who have developed the chloramphenicol-resistant infection in Los Angeles County alone jumped from 69 in 1984 to 298 the following year. Two of those victims died and half the victims in their study of 45 patients had to be hospitalized for their illness.     They also discovered that cooking the meat didn't always prevent the disease. Only 15 pct of the victims reported eating raw, infected hamburger. Thus, the researchers concluded, "the majority of cases appear to have been caused by eating hamburger that was at least partially cooked."     The researchers said the results show that "food animals are a major source of antimicrobial-resistant salmonella infections in humans, and that these infections are associated with (antibiotic) use on farms."

In a wide ranging address sponsored by the Export-Import Bank, Ortner, the bank's senior economist also said he believed that the yen was undervalued and could go up by 10 or 15 pct.     "I do not regard the dollar as undervalued at this point against the yen," he said.     On the other hand, Ortner said that he thought that "the yen is still a little bit undervalued," and "could go up another 10 or 15 pct."     In addition, Ortner, who said he was speaking personally, said he thought that the dollar against most European currencies was "fairly priced."     Ortner said his analysis of the various exchange rate values was based on such economic particulars as wage rate differentiations.     Ortner said there had been little impact on U.S. trade deficit by the decline of the dollar because at the time of the Plaza Accord, the dollar was extremely overvalued and that the first 15 pct decline had little impact.     He said there were indications now that the trade deficit was beginning to level off.     Turning to Brazil and Mexico, Ortner made it clear that it would be almost impossible for those countries to earn enough foreign exchange to pay the service on their debts.  He said the best way to deal with this was to use the policies outlined in Treasury Secretary James Baker's debt initiative.  Reuter &#3;

The National Farmers Union, NFU, remains concerned about the future ownership of British Sugar despite last week's decision by the government to block bids from Italy's Gruppo Ferruzzi and Britain's Tate &amp; Lyle Plc.     The union's sugar beet committee met yesterday to consider the implications of a government Monopolies and Merger Commission, MMC, report issued last week. "We are still concerned about S and W Berisford being long-term owners of British Sugar," a spokesman said. "We do not view Berisford as providing the long-term stability we want."     The Trade and Industry Secretary accepted a recommendation last week by the MMC that it block a bid by Tate and Lyle for S and W Berisford Plc and stop Gruppo Ferruzzi buying a majority of British Sugar, owned by Berisford.     Union officials believe a new bid for the monopoly beet processor is now likely. "We are looking again at the undertakings that we have demanded of existing bidders and which we would seek of any future bidders," the spokesman said. The NFU, which represents Britain's 11,500 sugar beet growers, is also taking legal advice on particular paragraphs in the MMC report which it says need further explanation.  Reuter &#3;

gnp,jobs	DUTCH GROWTH LIKELY TO SLOW, JOBLESS RISE IN 1987 .  Leaks of a major Dutch official economic forecast due to be published on Monday indicate reduced economic growth and a renewed rise in unemployment this year, political and market sources say.     Concern over an anticipated fall in Dutch competitiveness this year against a background of an average 2-1/2 pct wage increase, zero inflation and a firm guilder has triggered some calls for a change in monetary policy to help boost growth.     But whatever the government's response, the central bank will stick to its policy of keeping the guilder firm, they say.     The official forecasting agency Centraal Planbureau (CPB) publishes its 1987 outlook at the start of a week which will also see a key parliamentary debate on government finances and the economy.     Merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson - in an estimate reflecting general sentiment - said last month that Dutch economic growth was now seen around one pct.     Domestic consumer spending is not expected to offset the decline in export growth caused by slowing growth in West Germany, the main Dutch trading partner, and the lower dollar, Pierson said in its February economic outlook.     The latest growth forecasts are well below a 1.5 to two pct growth figure seen by the CPB early last month and forecasts of 2.5 pct economic growth in 1987 made last September.     The fall in unemployment is bottoming out and the government has already admitted it will not meet its goal of reducing unemployment by an annual 50,000 from 1986 to 1990.     Some analysts and industry leaders have questioned central bank policy of pegging the guilder firmly to the mark and if necessary keeping interest rates up to support the guilder.     Employers federation NCW chairman Fred Lempers criticised the guilder's revaluation in line with the West German mark in last January's European Monetary System (EMS) realignment and expressed concern over its effect on competitiveness.     But the employers federation VNO noted the Dutch economy had become more competitive since 1980 and the fall of the dollar was affecting this gain more than the EMS realignment.     Some analysts also question the central bank's decision not to copy the latest Bundesbank discount rate cut and instead lower money market rates and abolish a credit quota surcharge.     Central bank president Wim Duisenberg has defended the move saying the bank had adjusted the rates with the most impact on the money market, noting "the (4.5 pct) discount rate is at the moment not the most important Dutch rate because it is already far below the market rates."     Central bank officials say the heavy dependence on trade of the Dutch economy requires a stable exchange rate, and interest rate policies serve that goal.     Analysts noted a large capital outflow from the Netherlands recently as foreign investments in Dutch stock are being sold to take profits.     Loosening the tie between the guilder and the mark would reduce international confidence in the guilder and make it more dificult to attract foreign capital, they said, noting Dutch interest rates rose sharply when the guilder was not revalued completely in line with the mark in a 1983 EMS realignment.     Many Dutch banks have reacted favourably to the decision not to copy the last German discount rate cut, but Pierson warned it could actually add to uncertainty over the guilder.     Some analysts noted friction between the Finance Ministry and the central bank, with Finance Minister Onno Ruding having said before the Bundesbank discount rate cut he favoured lower Dutch rates but that the Germans should move first.     One analyst said Ruding wanted to bring interest rates down to reduce the government debt burden.     A Finance Ministry spokesman said lower interest rates were needed but denied any suggestion of conflicting views between the ministry and the central bank. "The cabinet's policy is steady, the guilder has to stay with the mark," he said.  REUTER &#3;

However, the bank said it will maintain the high level of provisioning for loan losses established last year because of many market uncertainties. Commerce bank set loan loss provisions of 636.0 mln dlrs in fiscal 1986, ended October 31.     The bank earlier said first quarter net income rose to 96.5 mln dlrs from 87.0 mln dlrs in the prior year. Profit per basic share after dividends fell to 61 cts from year-ago 64 cts.     Commerce Bank said because of market uncertainties, it used an estimate of 600.0 mln dlrs for fiscal 1987 loan losses in calculating first quarter results.     The bank's first quarter provision for loan losses rose to 172.0 mln dlrs, from 152.0 mln dlrs in the prior year.     Commerce Bank also said it will continue to adopt an agressive posture in adding to its general provisions against loan exposure to 34 countries designated by the federal government's Inspector General of Banks.     First quarter net partly benefitted from net interest income, up to 561.8 mln dlrs from year ago 540.9 mln dlrs.     Commerce Bank said improved other income, which rose to 213.6 mln dlrs from year-earlier 170.1 mln dlrs, and net income was partially offset by the increased loan loss provisions, non-interest expenses and income taxes.     The bank said first quarter total assets increased to 83.92 billion dlrs from 78.93 mln dlrs in the prior year, due mainly to continued expansion in consumer loan and mortgage fields.     Return on assets increased by two cts to 46 cts per 100 dlrs of average assets from the first quarter in fiscal 1986, but declined two cts from fiscal 1986 fourth quarter.     The bank also said total non-accrual loans increased to 2.4 billion dlrs in the first quarter from year-ago 1.8 billion dlrs. However, non-accrual loans declined 130 mln dlrs from fiscal 1986 year-end.     "Despite the recent announcement of the suspension of interest payments by Brazil, virtually all of the bank's loans to this country were income producing up to January 31, 1987, and there was little adverse impact on the bank's earnings prior to the announcement," Commerce bank said.

grain,wheat	WORLD GRAIN TRADE RECOVERY MAY BE UNDERWAY .  World grain trade could be turning the corner and heading toward recovery in the 1986-87 season, a Cargill, Inc. analyst said.     Writing in the March issue of the Cargill Bulletin, David Rogers of Cargill's Commodity Marketing Division cited a gradual rise in world wheat trade in recent months, with a slow rise in wheat prices after recent historic lows.     He said the wheat trade, because wheat can be produced in many nations, is a good barometer of world grain trade and could lead to more activity in other grain markets.     Rogers said that with world grain prices at their lowest level in over a quarter of a century in real terms, demand has begun to rise while producing nations are re-examining their expensive price-support policies and reducing planted acres.

Delegates from the National Pork Producers Council, NPPC, yesterday approved programs for control and eradication of pseudorabies and establishment of a national safe drug use program.     The delegate body, attending the American Pork Congress in Indianapolis, approved a pseudorabies control and eradication program at the state level after a recommendation from NPPC's PRV (pseudorabies virus) oversight committee.     The PRV committee received results of a three year, five state pilot project which had a 97.5 pct success rate in eradication of the disease within 116 hog herds. The project was jointly funded by the USDA and NPPC.     "Primarily it (the program) allows individual states to deal with their own problems according to a timetable that suits them best," Mike Wehler, member of the NPPC's PRV oversight committee said.     In regards to safe drug use, the delegates approved a plan asking that NPPC be active in establishing a national safe drug use program.     The program would establish better relationships between producers and veterinarians and eventually lead to a quality assurance program in pork production, according to the plan.     "This program basically communicates to the FDA that we are concerned about safe drug use and will do our part to use drugs safely, if FDA will allow the same policy to continue in effect," Wehler said.

interest	BANK OF ENGLAND RESISTS PRESSURE FOR RATE CUT .  The Bank of England again fought against money and bond market pressure for a pre-Budget interest rate cut, leaving the pound to take the strain with a further rise in its trade-weighted index to a six-month high.     It closed at its best level since September 12, at 71.4 pct of its 1975 value on the index, as foreign investors continued to buy into a currency which offers high relative returns and the possibility of short-term capital gains, dealers said.     Meanwhile, opinion is divided over whether the Bank can stop a cut before Budget Day, March 17, and why it should want to.     The Bank's latest strong signal to the market that it wants rates to stay steady for the moment came in midafternoon, when it lent to the discount houses at a penal rate of 11-3/4 pct to relieve a money market shortage.     "They're really making the discount houses suffer," said Stephen Lewis, economist at brokerage house Phillips and Drew. "Eleven and three-quarters pct is way above money market rates."     This money market signal was apparently not accompanied by any sterling sales on the foreign exchanges, talk of which had inhibited strong rises yesterday and Tuesday, so buyers came strongly into the pound.     The pound surged to a high of 1.5798/808 dlrs at the London close, up from the previous finish at 1.5650/60, and 2.8900/60 marks, up from 2.8720/50.     "If this pressure keeps up...There is a possibility that rates could drop before the Budget," said Jeremy Hale, economist at finance house Goldman Sachs International Corp.     Some gilt traders are forecasting a half-point cut in the base rate from the current 11 pct as early as tomorrow.     However, analysts said the Bank of England will need to be convinced that the present rise is a fundamental re-rating rather than a result of short-term speculative gains.     There are valid reasons for the Bank to be cautious, said Peter Fellner, U.K. Economist at brokers James Capel and Co.     Markets have become highly optimistic about the chances of a Conservative Party victory in any early general election, and disappointment if Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher decides to hold back could lead to a decline in the pound and a setback for bonds, Fellner said.     An election could be delayed until mid-1988, but most forecasts say it will be this year.     Others note that the pound could yet prove vulnerable to oil price losses or a change of fortune for the dollar.     However, analysts agree the Bank is largely trying to set the timing of a cut than holding out against one altogether.     The authorities traditionally prefer a single sustainable rate move, one way or the other, to half points here and there.     Some add the Bank will be influenced by signs that at least a proportion of the latest bout of sterling buying is long-term capital coming into the London market, notably from Japan.     They argue that the pound is being perceived as a safer bet than the dollar, given the latters recent sharp falls and current political upheavals in Washington.     The Bank may want to see another few points on the trade-weighted index before the Budget, argued Lewis. "But by then sterling should be firm enough to satisfy even the Bank of England," he added.     The Bank declined to comment on its reasons for resisting pressure for a rate move before the budget, but banking sources said the authorities see the recent rise in sterling as more than just marking up by foreign exchange traders.     Meanwhile, analysts noted the market ignored potentially harmful news on the trade front, today's figures showing that the current account deficit in 1986 was 1.1 billion stg.     This was above previous estimates of the current account deficit and compares with a surplus of 2.9 billion stg in 1985.     Fellner said that under more normal conditions this would have given the bond and currency markets a pause, but that they were too bullish to worry about such fundamentals.     The guessing game over the timing of a cut has the clearing banks divided as well as the markets. Privately, some bank officials forecast the Bank will hold out at least for this week, but at least one bank says a rise is possible tomorrow. If a move comes before March 17, forecasts are for a half-point cut, with another half or full point about Budget day.  REUTER &#3;

The sugar is being sought for early arrival and will probably be met with April/May shipment sugar, they added.     Earlier today newspapers in Turkey carried an advertisement from Turkish Sugar Factories inviting offers of 100,000 tonnes of crystal sugar with a 50 pct option to increase or decrease the amount.     Over the 1983/85 period Turkey each year has exported between 240,000 and 350,000 tonnes of whites to Iran and between 62,000 and 230,000 tonnes to Iraq.     Following lower sugar crops in the past two years analysts said Turkey needs to import sugar now if it is to continue filling these export contracts, and may need to buy more.     Last month London broker C Czarnikow estimated Turkish 1986/87 production at 1.42 mln tonnes raw value against 1.4 mln in 1985/86 and an average 1.76 mln in the previous three seasons.

Kistler said its counter proposal to merge with Baker International Corp was still under consideration and that a merger was in the best interests of both companies.     "Our hope is that we can come to a mutual agreement that is good for both companies," Kistler said of the proposed merger that would result in a 1.2 billion dlr oil field service company. "We're working very hard on this merger."     Hughes' board today again adjourned a shareholders meeting to vote on the proposed merger and rescheduled it for March 11 to give Baker more time to consider the counter proposal.     The Hughes board, which had previously expressed concern about a U.S. Department of Justice consent decree that would require Baker to sell its drilling bit operations and submersible pump business, met yesterday and threatened to terminate the proposed merger.     The Hughes board made a counter proposal that the two companies first find acceptable buyers for the businesses before signing the decree.     The directors of Baker immediately after receiving the counter proposal filed a law suit in Texas in a Texas state court to force to Hughes to complete the merger.     "The uncertainty as to the price and conditions that might be imposed by the Department of Justice makes us very nervous about what the outcome might be," Kistler said, in explaining why Hughes had made the counter proposal.     "We need additional time to understand why Baker did not accept our proposal."     Kistler also said that the law suit filed by Baker "was not a factor" in the board's decision to keep its merger proposal on the table.     He declined to comment on the allegations in the lawsuit.     Kistler said Hughes would be willing to consider a compromise counter proposal, but declined to be more specific.     The Justice Department in January said it would block the Hughes and Baker merger on anti-trust grounds unless both companies agreed to sign a consent decree that would provide for the sale of the assets after the merger took place.     The Hughes board said it would not sign the decree because its was too "unreasonable." Hughes said that Baker should instead complete the sale of the disputed assets before the merger is finalized and given government approval.     Under the decree, if Baker is unable to find acceptable buyers within a specified period of time after the decree is approved, a federal trustee would become responsible for finding a buyer.     Kistler said that under those terms, the trustee could take up to 10 years to complete the sales.     He also expressed concern that the combined companies might be required by the government's conditions to license some of its technology to any purchaser of the assets.     Baker said last night in a statement that the required assets to be sold would reduce revenues by about 65 mln dlrs, representing about three pct of the revenues of the combined companies.

The French government is to sell to the public its 47.42 pct direct holding in Societe Generale &lt;STGN.PA>'s regional bank subsidiary &lt;Societe Generale Alsacienne de Banque>, SOGENAL, from next Monday, SOGENAL officials said.     SOGENAL, founded in 1881 and nationalised in 1982, is the leading French regional bank and has branches in Austria, Belgium, Luxembourg, East and West Germany and Switzerland.     Chairman Rene Geronimus told a news conference the share offer price, expected to be announced tomorrow by Finance Minister Edouard Balladur, would be between 110 and 130 francs.     Societe Generale, which will itself be privatised later this year, will retain its 52.58 pct majority holding in the bank, Chairman Marc Vienot said.     SOGENAL officials said they forecast 1987 consolidated group profit of around 170 mln francs after an estimated 160 mln this year and 159 mln in 1985.     SOGENAL's privatisation will be preceded by a capital increase to 320 mln francs from 263 mln, earning about 250 mln francs in new funds. Its shares will be divided by eight, giving a capital of 12.8 mln shares of 25 francs nominal.     The bank will be listed on the Nancy stock exchange, in line with the Finance Ministry and government's aim of a regional operation, Geronimus said.     He said he was hoping for shareholders to total around 30,000 to 35,000 against the 12,500 before nationalisation. Ten pct of the capital to be floated will be reserved for employees with the rest offered to the public. There will not be a share reserved for foreign investors. "This is too small an operation and anyway they will be able to buy shares in France," he said.     Stockbroker sources said that a likely share offer price of 120 francs would value SOGENAL at 1.5 billion francs.     Geronimus said the bank's future aim would be to reinforce its existing strong points, with no major projects planned apart from the opening soon of a Basle branch.     SOGENAL is the only French bank in Austria, it set up the first foreign exchange dealing room outside Paris at its Strasbourg headquarters in 1985, and is the only foreign banking subsidiary to be a broker on the Zurich Bourse.

retail	FEBRUARY U.S. RETAIL SALES NOT SIGN OF UPTURN .  U.S. retailers posted stronger than expected sales in February, but not enough to prompt analysts to change their expectations of sluggish sales growth for the first half of 1987.      "My feeling is that it (February) borrowed some of the business we normally see later in the quarter and the real strength of general merchandise sales will be in the second half of 1987," said Bear Stearns and Co analyst Monroe Greenstein.     "I don't think March will be as strong because Easter falls in April this year," said Morgan Stanley analyst Walter Loeb.    Analysts generally average the sales results of March and April to account for the variation of Easter's occurrence.     Analyst Edward Johnson of Johnson Redbook Associates said sales for February rose between six and 6.5 pct, compared to a 3.6 pct increase last year.      Analysts noted that February is considered a small, transitory month between winter and spring.     In addition, sales comparisons were boosted by an especially soft February last year which was adversely affected by severe weather.     Apparel sales outshone other product groups in sales, according to retailers and analysts.     "February's strong sales reflected a lot of fresh merchandise on the shelves and higher consumer income due to tax reductions," said Greenstein of Bear Stearns.     Analysts expect apparel sales to remain good as sales of durable and houseware items grow softer due to the continuing high levels of consumer debt.      May Department Stores Co &lt;MAY> and K Mart Corp &lt;KM> were among the strong performers, posting comparable store sales gains of 9.4 pct and 8.2 pct, respectively. May had an overall sales gain of 15.0 pct and K Mart had a 13.1 pct sales gain  last month.     "Favorable consumer response to our merchandise programs continued to positively impact our sales comparisons. IN addition to the strong contribution by K Mart stores, all our specialty retailing companies had excellent February sales," said K Mart chairman Bernard Fauber.     Sears Roebuck and Co &lt;S> posted a 4.9 pct increase. "Domestic sales were led by better than average increases in apparel, home fashions and hardware and especially strong catalog sales," said Sears chairman Edward Brennan.     Analysts were a little disappointed by J.C. Penney Co Inc &lt;JCP> which started out with especially strong sales early in the month. Penney posted a 5.5 pct increase on a comparitive store basis and a 5.3 pct gain in overall sales.     Penney chairman William Howell said, "store sales were strongest during the early part of the month, while catalog demand was consistently strong throughout the period.     Store sales activity varied throughout the country, ranging from good in the East to weak in the depressed southwest.     Analysts also said gross profit margins were high as retailers were not overly promotional due to leaner inventories than a year ago.     "February is not a big month seasonally but these numbers suggest a fairly good trend for consumer spending," said Drexel Burnham Lambert analyst Jeff Edelman.

Kodak said it secured worldwide marketing rights for three of Enzon's PEG enzymes used in the treatment of oxygen toxicity disorders, hyperuricemia and gout.     The company said it acquired two mln Enzon shares for 15 mln dlrs, with loans to Enzon of two mln dlrs and interest of 30,000 dlrs credited against the purchase price.     Kodak said the drugs covered by the marketing rights are in initial stages of the U.S. Food and Drug Administration approval process.  It said the investment should provide the necessary capital to complete the FDA review process and provide a marketing outlet for the drugs.     The drugs are PEG-superoxide disdmutase and PEG-catalase, for use against oxygen toxicity disorders that cause the often-fatal tissue damage associated with severe burns, organ transplants, heart attacks and trauma, and PEG-uricase, for treatment of gout and other conditions caused by the buildup of high levels of uric acid in the body.

gnp,trade	FED'S JOHNSON STRESSES PRICE STABILITY .  Federal Reserve Board Vice Chairman Manuel Johnson said that maintaining price stability was critical to achieving non-inflationary economic growth in the world and said that progress was being made.     "It is worth reiterating that the Federal Reserve's promotion of price stability is critical to the successful implementation of virtually all of the important ingredients for growth," he told the Eastern Economic Association.     Johnson said initial progress has been made on a variety of fronts. "Federal Reserve monetary policy, the Gramm-Rudman-Hollings legislation, the G-6 agreement, and the Baker debt initiative for example all have moved us in the right direction," he said. G-6 is comprised of U.S., Britain, France, Japan, West Germany and Canada.     On the budget deficit, Johnson said meeting precise numerical goals was less important than a continuing commitment toward slowing the growth of federal spending.     There was evidence deficits as a pct of Gross National Product were declining and would continue to drop, he said.     But Johnson warned against reliance on inflow of foreign capital to finance investment and the budget deficit and keep interest rates stable.     "This situation, however, cannot continue indefinitely. Sooner or later progress must be made in controlling excessive federal spending," he said.     A disinflationary monetary policy should continue to be the main objective of the Fed, Johnson said.     He also said a more stable and sustainable alignment of exchange rates was needed for long-term growth.     On the trade deficit, Johnson warned against "quick fix" solutions, which he identified as excessive dollar depreciation or protectionist trade legislation.     "What is important is that we attempt to maintain healthy returns to capital and adopt policies encouraging genuine economic growth," he said.     Such an approach would finance the trade deficit but allow for its gradual resolution over time.  Reuter &#3;

A Treasury Department spokesman refused comment on statements by Robert Ortner, undersecretary of economic affairs for the Commerce Department, that the Japanese yen was undervalued.     Ortner, senior economist at the Commerce Department, told an Export-Import Bank conference "the yen is still a little bit undervalued," and "could go up another 10 or 15 pct."     Asked for reaction, a Treasury spokesman said officials were aware of Ortner's comments but had no intention of making any comment on them.     Ortner, who stressed he was expressing personal views, said he thought the U.S. dollar was "fairly priced" against most European currencies and added "I do not regard the dollar as undervalued at this point against the yen," he said.     But the yen should go up 10 or 15 pct in value, Ortner said, because it is undervalued against the dollar.

Imperial Chemical Industries PLC expects earnings from its pharmaceuticals operations to grow   to about 35 pct of world profits within the next five years compared with a current 30 pct, chairman elect Denys Henderson told financial analysts.     "Over the next five years we expect to launch one major new product each year," Henderson said.     He also said research and development spending in this business segment will be increased to 14 pct of total sales income in 1987 from 13 pct, or 130 mln sterling, in 1986.     ICI, the world's fifth largest chemicals firm in terms of sales, recently reported 1986 profits of about 888 mln dlrs on 15 billion dlrs in sales, compared with income of 817 mln dlrs on 15.87 billion dlrs in sales a year earlier.     Sales in the United States totaled about three billion dlrs, ICI executives said.     In addition, Henderson said overall corporate growth will come from ICI's research and development activities, but the company intends to continue to grow through an acquisition program.     ICI spent just under one billion dlrs for acquisitions during 1986, the largest of which was the 580 mln dlr purchase of Cleveland, Ohio-based Glidden Inc, a paints, resins and coatings company, from &lt;Hanson Trust PLC>.     ICI financial director Alan Clements said the company's borrowing limits are at a level of about 6.3 billion sterling, 1.5 billion of which have already been used.

ship	ROTTERDAM PORT SUBSIDY TO END JULY 1 - MINISTER .  Dutch Social Affairs Minister Louw de Graaf announced he is withdrawing the annual 10 mln guilder labour subsidy for Rotterdam's strike-hit general cargo sector as from July 1.     Late last month de Graaf said that if the dispute was not settled by Monday this week he would withdraw the subsidy.     The chairman of the port employers' organization, SVZ, Jacques Schoufour, said he was unhappy with the decision and added there was now no alternative to proceeding with redundancy plans.     The series of strikes in the sector started on January 19 in protest at employers' plans to make 800 redundancies from the 4,000-strong workforce by 1990 starting with 350 this year.     Meanwhile, the port and transport union, FNV, attacked loss figures given for the port for this year.     The figures, issued by accountants on behalf of the SVZ, put total losses for last year at 34 mln guilders and in 1985 at 37 mln. Earlier, the employers had put the figure at around 30 mln.     The FNV said the actual losses were nearer 17 to 20 mln and said the employers had inflated the figures as part of their plan to restructure completely the port's general cargo sector.  Reuter &#3;

ship	STRIKING BRAZILIAN SEAMEN HOLD PAY TALKS .  Striking Brazilian seamen, who say they have made idle 158 ships and halted Brazilian exports, today held pay talks in Rio de Janeiro with Labour Minister Almir Pazzianotto, union officials said.     Jorge Luis Leao Franco, a senior official of the National Merchant Marine Union, told Reuters he was optimistic the talks would lead to an end of the stoppage, which began last Friday.     Brazil's 40,000 seamen are seeking a pay rise of 275 pct.     The union official said the strike had halted a total of 158 vessels, including 50 in Brazil's main port, Santos, and about 50 more in Rio de Janeiro.     Abroad, six ships lay idle, in the Netherlands, Spain, Venezuela, France and South Africa, he said.     Economic analysts said the strike was of serious concern to the government, which has already had to suspend interest payments on part of Brazil's foreign debt following a drastic deterioration in the country's trade balance.     The head of the National Merchant Marine Authority, Murilo Rubens Habbema, was quoted in today's Gazeta Mercantil newspaper as saying that if the strike continued foreign ships could be authorized to transport Brazilian exports.     "Brazil is living through a crisis at the moment, and it is not conceivable that exports be hit," he said.     "But even using foreign ships we must not forget that we are going to lose foreign exchange paying freight charges abroad, and all this through the fault of the seamen," Rubens Habbema said.     A spokesman for the port of Santos, which has been the scene of labour unrest and congestion in recent months, said movement of ships out of the port was running at about half its normal level of 12 ships a day.     He said a total of 76 ships were either waiting at anchor on moored in the harbour.  Reuter &#3;

trade,money-fx	YEUTTER SAYS BUDGET CUT KEY TO BETTER U.S. TRADE .  A reduction of the U.S. federal budget deficit will be needed to help eliminate the nation's huge trade deficit, U.S. trade representative Clayton Yeutter said.     Speaking to the New York Chamber of Commerce and Industry, Yeutter said "Capital and trade flows are clearly inter-releated now.     "Unless we get the budget deficit down, we will not get the trade deficit down."     He did not elaborate on his views of the linkages between the two deficits.     Private analysts have said that the financing of large U.S. budget deficits requires heavy capital inflows from overseas investors through purchases of U.S. Treasury and, to a lesser extent, other U.S. securities as well.     "We'll make some progress in reducing the 170 billion dlr trade deficit in 1987, but there's still a long way to go," Yeutter said.     He said the problem must be approached on many fronts and focus most strongly on U.S. and overseas fiscal and monetary policies to foster economic growth, U.S. competitiveness and the establishment of a "level playing field" for trade.     The U.S. trade representative said the Federal Reserve under Chairman Paul Volcker has done its part to improve the trade situation by getting interest rates down.     On the fiscal side, Yeutter said "the budget deficit is still our biggest problem" and there has not been enough progress toward reducing that deficit.     In the international area, he said that "our major trading partners could still do more to stimulate domestic growth." Commenting on Japan, which is running around a 80 billion dlr trade surplus with the United States, Yeutter said "Japan is just not doing the job on the import side."     Yeutter declined to comment on statements relating to the dollar made earlier today by Commerce Dept undersecretary of Economic Affairs Robert Ortner.     In a Washington address to an Export-Import Bank sponsored meeting, Ortner said he believed the dollar at current levels was fairly priced against most European currencies, but that the yen is 10 or 15 pct undervalued.     "The market will determine the dollar's proper value in the end," Yeutter said. However, he added that, if the U.S. and other nations do not take the necessary steps to cut the U.S. trade deficit, "the dollar will be the equalizer."     Yeutter said there is no quick fix to the trade problem and any resort to such tactics as protectionist trade legislation or trade restrictions poses real dangers.     He said "there's relatively little that Congress can do to legislate a solution to the trade problem."     Protectionist legislation will only provoke retaliation by U.S. trading partners, Yeutter said.     "There is no doubt in my mind about the willingness of our trading partners to retaliate against unfair trade legislation," Yeutter said, adding that policy flexibility is essential in solving international trade problems.

money-fx,dlr,yen	NEW CURRENCY PROBLEM SEEN AMONG U.S, EUROPE, JAPAN .  The highly visible drama involving the yen's sharp rise against the U.S. Dollar is obscuring the fact that the Japanese currency has hardly budged against major European currencies, thus creating a new set of exchange rate distortions, Japanese and European research officials said.     The officials, looking beneath the rhetoric of statements by the Group of Five (G-5) industrial nations, told Reuters the currency movements of the past two years are also creating a fundamentally new world trade picture, which is throwing up new trade tensions and imbalances.     Trade figures show that the new currency alignments are already changing the Japan-U.S. Trade axis into a Japan- European Community (EC) axis, to the discomfort of Europe.     In many ways, not least in terms of rare international cooperation, the September, 1985 New York Plaza pact between the U.S., Japan, West Germany, Britain and France to cut down the value of the dollar was a historic one.     But it is the underlying peaks and troughs of the major currency movements which lay bare the real picture, in which the Plaza pact appears as an event of prime importance, but not necessarily central significance, the officials said.     The officials said that when the Plaza agreement took place, the dollar was already on its way down. The agreement simply helped it on its way. Senior EC financial expert in Tokyo Tomas de Hora has watched the movements closely.     "You have to look at the dollar's peak compared with now, and that was well before Plaza," he said.     On February 25, 1985, the dollar peaked against the yen at 263.15 yen. On September 20, the Friday before Plaza, it was 242. Since then, despite massive Bank of Japan intervention and periodic market frights about further G-5 concerted action, the dollar trend has been down, down, down.     Yet the ECU is now around 173.4 yen. The historical cross rates for sterling and the mark tell much the same story. The European currencies are moving back up against the yen.     The close relationship between exchange rates and trade flows makes it difficult to see which is driving which, but undoubtedly the trade equation between the big three is changing. In 1986, Japanese imports and exports with the EC both grew by around 50 pct in dollar terms, five pct in yen. This gave Japan a 16 billion dlr trade surplus.     Last January, Japanese exports to the EC totalled half of of sales to the U.S, against about a third in recent years.     Trade with the U.S in 1986 rose 23 pct for exports and 12 pct for imports in dollar terms, but fell 13 pct for exports and 21 pct for imports in yen terms.     "The basic meaning for Europe is that Japanese firms have a tremendous interest in exporting to Europe, where every unit sold maximises profits in yen terms, which is what is important to them. Suddenly, instead of the U.S., It is Europe that is laying the golden egg," said de Hora.     The EC is worried. EC business also had a remarkable year in Japanese sales, but this can be explained partly due to its start from a small base, compared with total Japan-U.S. Trade.     The Japanese think EC firms are now more competitive than U.S. Firms, a factor which is aggravating the exchange rate imbalance, and which will cause problems.     "This currency alignment between Japan and the EC is reflecting the excellent performance of the EC countries. But therefore, Japanese goods may keep their price competitive edge," said Azusa Hayashi, Director of the First International Economic Affairs Division of the Foreign Ministry. "If you want my objective view, I don't expect a drastic improvement in our trade imbalance. Last year, we asked for moderation in exports, and this year we may have to do so again," he said.

earn	TANDEM COMPUTERS &lt;TNDM> SEES HIGHER NET .  Tandem Computers Inc said it expects higher earnings and revenues in its second fiscal quarter ending March 31 against a year ago.     "We feel we will continue to see higher growth in the quarter," James Treybig, president and and chief executive officer, told a meeting of securities analysts.     In the second fiscal quarter last year, Tandem earned 9,950,000 dlrs or 29 cts per share on revenues of 176.3 mln dlrs.     Treybig declined to offer specific projections for the quarter but he said the results might be lower than those for the first quarter of fiscal 1987, when Tandem earned 27.1 mln dlrs or 58 cts a share. He said Tandem's second quarter is traditionally slower than the first.     L.F. Rothschild Unterberg Towbin analyst Frederic Cohen estimated Tandem's second quarter net at 40 to 45 cts per share. For the full year, he said he expects the computer maker to earn about 2.40 dlrs a share. In fiscal 1986, Tandem earned 1.44 dlrs a share.     Treybig, who founded the Cupertino, Calif.-based company, said he has seen a rebound in computer orders in the United States. "The U.S. economy is picking up, and buying decisions are being made. We didn't see that a year ago," he said.     The executive said Tandem will increase its research and development spending to about 100 mln dlrs this year from 87 mln dlrs in fiscal 1986.     He said the company plans to introduce several products, including two low-end systems and a data base that uses the SQL programming language, an industry standard. Tandem also won a major order from the &lt;Bank of Tokyo>.   Reuter &#3;
trade,sugar,cotton,groundnut,oilseed	AUSTRALIA ATTACKS U.S. GATT FARM RULES EXEMPTION .  Australia accused the U.S. of increasing protectionism on agricultural products and called for an end to Washington's special 32-year exemption from certain GATT rules on agricultural trade.     Robert Arnott, Australia's delegate to the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade (GATT), made the appeal at a special annual meeting which reviews the 1955 U.S. waiver.     "Australia today said the United States' goals of reducing U.S. barriers to agricultural trade were being contradicted by actions which in fact increased protection in trade in agriculture," the Australian delegation said in a statement.     "The United States section 22 waiver is one of the basic flaws in the GATT coverage of agriculture," Arnott told the meeting.     Arnott said the waiver had continually been used as a justification for "dubious protective measures" by the U.S. He listed a recent Dairy Export Incentive Program and steps to close the U.S. sugar market to imports.     He also told Reuters the waiver allowed Washington to impose quotas on imports of farm products where it had domestic support programs. This covered imports of dairy products, peanuts, cotton and sugar.     Asked to comment, Michael Samuels, U.S. ambassador to the GATT, told Reuters: "These charges have been made since the very beginning. The waiver is part of domestic U.S. agricultural policy, part of our law when we joined the GATT".     "We have agreed to put the waiver on the table during the Uruguay Round and invite other countries to do the same with their programs. We can negotiate them all," Samuels added.     Ninety-two nations are taking part in the four-year Uruguay round of talks launched in Punta del Este last September. Bargaining in agricultural goods and services (banking, tourism, insurance) is included for the first time as well as manufactured goods.  Reuter &#3;

grain,wheat	HOUSE 0/92 FARM PROPOSAL SEEN SPARKING DEBATE .  A House Agriculture Committee meeting later today to draft a disaster aid bill is expected to spark a debate between lawmakers who want to expand the 0/92, or "de-coupling," provision to cover feedgrains, and those who oppose 0/92 or want it severely limited, Congressional sources said.     The disaster aid bill as it now stands calls for a one-year 0/92 pilot program for 1987 crop wheat and the 1988 winter wheat crop. The bill would allow farmers to forego planting and still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.     The administration has strongly urged that the bill be expanded to feedgrains and to more than one year.     It is difficult to tell in what form the 0/92 provision will emerge from the committee, the sources said.     Proponents of an expansion of 0/92 maintain there are large estimated cost savings of such a bill -- ranging from estimates by the administration of 200 to 500 mln dlrs.     Opposition to a reopening of the 1985 farm bill at this time is the major reason cited by those against an expansion of the bill, committee staffers said.     The 0/92 plan is scheduled to be discussed at 1530 EST. A conflicting floor vote delayed the start of the meeting, and staffers said it may have to be delayed even until next week.     Such a delay would not bode well for proponents of an expanded 0/92 program, since spring planting in many areas of the country will be underway in the next few weeks and signup for the 1987 wheat and feedgrains program ends March 30.     Farmers are now making their planting decisions, so something has to be done quickly if a 0/92 program is to be implemented, an Agriculture Department source said.     An expansion of 0/92 to feedgrains was opposed in last week's subcommittee hearing on the bill, with subcommittee chairman Dan Glickman, D-Kan., saying that more study of the consequences of decoupling on feedgrains plantings was necessary.     Major commodity groups, including the National Corn Growers, the American Farm Bureau and the National Cattlemen's Association, have voiced strong opposition to 0/92.     But proponents of an expanded 0/92 argue that the bill currently is not equitable for all grains producers, so it should be extended to other crops.     There will be difficulty in limiting 0/92 to wheat, said Gene Moos, aide to house majority leader Tom Foley, D-Wash.     Projected cost savings, in the current atmosphere of try to decrease farm expenditures, would also be hard to ignore in the debate to expand the 0/92 application, Moos said.     Rep. Charles Stenholm, D-Tex., may be planning to introduce a bill to restrict 0/92 to only 1987 crop wheat, with the argument that now is not the time to vote in favor of any major changes in the farm bill.     "Stenholm's bill is not a rejection of 0/92, only of the timing," a congressional staff member said.     Rep. Arland Stangeland (R-Minn.) is reported to have an amendment to expand the 0/92 provision to 1987 and 1988 feedgrains.  Reuter &#3;

Yellow Freight System Inc said its expects 1987 first quarter profits to be substantially below the 14.2 mln dlrs or 50 cts a share earned in the same period a year ago.

An industry-wide rate hike of 2.9 pct, set for April one, will cover Yellow Freight's upcoming labor and other costs but will not make a contribution to operating margins, it said.  Reuter &#3;

acq	TALKING POINT/PIEDMONT &lt;PIE> .  Carl Icahn's bold takeover bid for USAir Group &lt;U> has clouded the fate of Piedmont Aviation Inc, which was being courted by USAir.     Yesterday, Icahn's Transworld Airlines Inc &lt;TWA> made a 1.4 billion dlr offer for USAir Group. The move complicated a USAir takeover offer for Piedmont, which was believed to be close to accepting the bid.     Today, USAir rejected Icahn's 52 dlr per share offer and said the bid was a last-minute effort to interfere in its takeover of Piedmont. Icahn was unavailable for comment.     Piedmont fell one to 68-5/8 on volume of 963,000. TWA was off 3/8 to 31-1/2. USAir fell 1-3/8 to 47-3/4 as doubt spread it would be taken over.     Analysts and market sources view the TWA bid as an attempt to either trigger a counter offer from USAir or to attract a suitor who might want both airlines once they merged.    "The next move is either Icahn starts a tender offer or Piedmont and USAir announce a deal," speculated one arbitrager.     Some arbitragers said there is now some risk in the current price of Piedmont since it is not clear that USAir's bid will succeed.     Piedmont's largest shareholder and other suitor, Norfolk Southern Corp &lt;NSC> has offered 65 dlrs per share for the company. USAir offered 71 dlrs cash per share for half of Piedmont stock, and 73 dlrs per share in stock for the balance.     Some arbitragers, however, believe the depressed price of Piedmont offers a buying opportunity since the airline is destined to be acquired by someone. USAir, they said, is the least likely to be bought.     Icahn, who has long talked about further consolidation in the airline industry, also offered USAir the alternative of a three-way airline combination, including TWA and Piedmont.     But Wall Street has given little credibility to Icahn's offer, which lacked financing and was riddled with contingencies.     Still, he has succeeded in holding up a merger of two airlines - both of which analysts said would fit well with TWA.     "You can't discount him," said one arbitrager.     Analysts, however, said Icahn would have to prove he is serious by following through with his threats or making a new offer. In making the offer for USAir, Icahn threatened to go directly to shareholders for 51 pct of the stock at a lower price if USAir rejected his offer.     "It's clear Icahn wants to sell and he's bluffing," said one arbitrager.     Analysts said the 52 dlr per share offer was underpriced by about six dlrs per share.     Some analysts believe Icahn's proposed three-way airline combination might face insurmountable regulatory hurdles, but others believe it could be cleared if the companies are acquired separately.     "TWA would have to be the surviving company for the deal to work," said one analyst.     Analysts said such a merger would be costly and complicated. TWA has the best cost structure, since Icahn succeeded in winning concessions from its unions.     In order for the other carriers to come down to TWA's wage scale in a merger, TWA would have to be the surviving entity, analysts said.     Such a move does not necessarily free Icahn of TWA, they said. They said he showed skill in reducing Ozark Airlines' costs when he merged it into TWA last year, and he might be a necessary ingredient for a merger to work.     However, other analysts speculated the managements of Piedmont and USAir would not tolerate Icahn as head of a new company. They said a USAir acquisition of TWA might be a way for him to exit the company if USAir's airline is then merged into TWA.  Reuter &#3;

Baker International Corp treasurer Eric Mattson said the company hoped to iron out snags in a proposed merger with Hughes Tool Co &lt;HT> but declined to say if or what compromises might be acceptable to it.     The proposed merger that would create a 1.2 billion dlr oilfield services company was thrown into limbo yesterday when Hughes management, balking at the terms of a government consent decree, offered a counter-proposal to Baker.     Earlier today, Hughes adjourned a shareholders meeting called to vote on the proposed merger until March 11 and said it hoped to resume negotitations with Baker.     Hughes chairman W.A. Kistler told reporters that Hughes did not want to sign the Department of Justice consent decree until after Baker's submersible pump and drilling bit operations were sold.     Mattson told Reuters that Baker still believed a merger was possible between the two giant oilfield service companies.     "The company's position is we would like to see the merger be completed, which is in the best interests of our shareholders and their shareholders," Mattson said.     "Our goal is for a merger to occur. Because of the litigation, I can't go any further than that," he said.     Baker filed a lawsuit in Texas state court late yesterday to force Hughes to abide by terms of the proposed consent decree.

crude	OPEC PRESIDENT SAYS OUTPUT WELL BELOW CEILING .  Opec Conference President Rilwanu Lukman said the group was producing well below the 15.8 mln bpd ceiling it set in December, partly because liftings had been delayed or postponed by customers unwilling to pay fixed Opec prices.     Lukman, during a brief visit to London on his way home from Jamaica, told Reuters in a telephone interview that in February, Opec had underproduced partly because members were strictly abiding by production quotas and partly because they were resisting the temptation to sell at discounts to official prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel.     "We are determined to stand firm by the (December) accord," he said. "I have spoken to every other Opec minister and they are committed to making the accord work," he said.     Lukman gave no specific figures for February output. He said the Opec secretariat in Vienna was finalizing these figures.     Told of a Reuters survey published today which estimated that Opec output so far this week was below 15 mln bpd, he said; "That could well be correct."     Opec"s news agency Opecna today issued a statement saying group output was "well below" its ceiling in February. But it gave no figures.     But one source close to Opec indicated that February output may have been between 15.3 and 15.5 mln bpd.     The Reuter survey estimated Opec February output at around 16 mln bpd.     Opec agreed in December to cut output by 7.25 pct to 15.8 mln bpd and to return to fixed prices starting February 1.     Lukman said Qatar, Nigeria, Saudi Arabia and Iran had all produced in February below their Opec quotas. Iraq, which said it would not honour its 1.466 mln bpd quota under the December pact, had produced less than had been anticipated, he said.     Lukman said that some industry reports "may be correct" that in February, Nigeria propuced 75-100,000 bpd below its 1.238 mln bpd quota, Saudi Arabia 500,000 bpd less than its 4.133 mln allocation and Qatar 20 to 30 pct under its 285,000 bpd quota.     He said that sweet crudes such as those produced by his country were coming under price pressure because they were currently officially priced above sweet North Sea grades and the United States" West Texas Intermediate (WTI) crude.     However, he said Opec in December had anticipated that demand would be slack at this time of year for seasonal reasons and expected the market to firm in two to three weeks.     "We have to be patient for two or three weeks. The market is now firming on actual fundamentals," he said, adding that he expected it to go "up and up" even beyond official prices after early April. This is when, traditionally, there is more demand for gasoline-rich crudes such as Nigeria"s.     The Opec President said producers such as Kuwait, Venezuela and Indonesia were having less problems with output than producers like his own country because they exported oil products.     Also, some of Venezuela"s heavy grades were outside the Opec pricing system, he said.     Lukman said that if refiner-buyers, now refusing to lift some Opec oil at official prices, instead used their own stocks and ran them down to "dangerous levels," they would eventually have to buy Opec oil.     "When they realise it is not a free-for-all (in the market) they will realise they should buy now instead of paying more later on," he said.     Lukman, asked about industry reports that Nigeria was being pressured by equity producers for better terms, said it was important to know that terms with them were negotiable, flexible and under constant review, not only when the market seemed weak.     He said that so far, no meeting of the seven-nation ministerial differentials committee had been scheduled and that such a meeting, now twice-postponed, was not a high priority for Opec at the moment.     "At this time, we have to get our priorities right," he said. "The most important thing now is ensuring that the accord is working, not dealing with a differential of cents between grades."     But if any Opec member raised concerns or objections over the differential system, a meeting would be called, he said.  Reuter &#3;

Over 750,000 head of cattle are suffering the effects of a severe shortage of feed as a result of a prolonged drought in the normally rich sugar and cattle producing province of Camaguey, the newspaper Granma reported.     The province produces 23 pct of Cuba's beef and is the island's number two province in milk production. Granma said 20,000 head of cattle are now in imminent danger.     The newspaper said a "cattle emergency" had been decreed and the cattle are being rounded up.     Some 110,000 head have been transferred to the sugar cane conditioning centers where newly harvested cane is cleaned before being sent to the mills. The cattle are being fed the residue left after cleaning the cane stalks. 32,000 head have been sent to nearby provinces of Las Tunas and Ciego de Avila.     Despite Cuba's ambitous cattle development plans, beef rationing has been in effect over the past 25 years. In Havana, each Cuban receives approximately 3/4 lb of rationed beef every 18 days.     In a major area hit by drought, San Miguel, practically no rain has fallen in the past 14 months. Grazing lands are parched and the region was unable to produce 117,000 tonnes of silage projected in its annual plan.

money-fx,can	CANADA DLR DRIVEN BY FOREIGN BUYERS - WILSON .  Finance Minister Michael Wilson said large inflows of capital into Canada, principally into the country's bond market, is a major reason behind the sharp recovery in the Canadian dollar.     He said the inflow of funds, mainly from Japan, Europe and the United States, is the result of "confidence in the direction this country is going in."     "That is the reason why the (Canadian) dollar today is higher than 75 cts (U.S.) compared to this time last year (when it was) a little over 69 cts," Wilson told the House of Commons daily question period.     Figures released this week show foreigners purchased a record 23.1 billion dlrs of Canadian bonds in 1986, more than double the previous year, with Japan investing a record 9.5 billion dlrs in the market.     Wilson was responding to opposition party questions about a possible loss of jobs from the rise in Canadian investment abroad. Canadian investment, including the buying of foreign companies, stocks and bonds, rose to 12.53 billion dlrs from 6.19 billion dlrs in 1985.     The minister said the flow of funds from abroad would generate many new jobs in Canada.  Reuter &#3;

trade	CONSENSUS BUILDS FOR WORLD AGRICULTURAL REFORM .  Top U.S. and European farm trade and government representatives called for a sweeping reform of world agriculture to redress a critical demand and supply imbalance.     Speakers at a conference on world agricultural markets here demonstrated a growing U.S.-European consensus on the need for an urgent and collective overhaul of world farm trade and production.     "It is vital that we work together to bring more freedom and harmony into the world agricultural trade...(if not) the disruptions in markets may grow even more severe, the walls of protection climb higher and the level of possible retaliation become more harmful," U.S. Department of Agriculture Deputy Administrator William Bailey said.     Bailey said his attendance at the two-day meeting, which ends tomorrow, demonstrated the U.S. recognises the need to adjust its policies to the changing market environment.     The need for urgent reforms is justified by the "imbalance and tensions of the world economy," the secretary general of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development Jean-Claude Paye said.     And the forum for such a reform is the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, he noted.     Paye stressed the need for a progressive and joint reduction of agricultural subsidies as well as social measures to help farmers in unprofitable areas.     Another possible solution would be to stop supporting farm prices, allowing them to be fixed by supply and demand, and instead help farmers through income support and adjustment aids, proposed James Howard, Executive Vice-president of Cargill (USA), one of the world's largest cereal houses.     Franz-Josef Feiter, agricultural adviser to West German Chancellor Helmut Kohl, agreed the European Community must take greater heed of market constraints in fixing farm prices.     However, "differentiated policy treatment is required" to take account of large disparities in the situation around the EC, he said.     "Agriculture is an efficient sector of the European economy and will remain so if the right policy is pursued within the Community," he said.  Reuter &#3;

The company released its audited 1986 results.     The company also said its long term debt was reduced by about 1.5 billion dlrs from the third quarter to the end of the year by asset sales and equity offerings. Union Carbide sold its battery products, home and automobile products and agricultural products businesses in 1986. In the fourth quarter, it offered 30 mln shares of stock, raising about 650 mln dlrs.     The asset sales and equity offering were part of a recapitalization plan undertaken by the chemicals company last year.     Audited net earnings in 1986 of 496 mln dlrs or 4.78 dlrs a share compared to a 1985 loss of 581 mln dlrs or 2.78 dlrs were unchanged from the company's preliminary earnings report made on Jan 28. The earnings results for the fourth quarter were also unchanged.     Included in the 1986 numbers are a 564 mln dlr gain from sale of the different businesses, a 270 mln dlr pension credit and a charge of 473 mln dlrs from the purchase of long term debt at a premium under the recapitalization.     In the audited results released today, the company broke down results by business segment.     Operating profit in the fourth quarter for all of the company's operations on a consolidated basis, before corporate and interest expense and taxes, was 181 mln dlrs against a loss of three mln dlrs in the 1985 quarter.     In the year, operating profit was 791 mln dlrs compared to a loss of 253 mln dlrs in 1985.     In a statement, the company said it defeated a hostile takeover attempt, by GAF Corp &lt;GAF>, and recapitalized the company, adding, "While all this was going on, our continuing businesses performed very soundly, with substantial operating profit improvement over 1985."     Carbon products posted operating profit of eight mln dlrs in the quarter, down from 29 mln dlrs, and 49 mln dlrs in the year against a loss of 146 mln dlrs.     Chemicals and plastics had fourth quarter operating profit of 122 mln dlrs compared to a year-ago loss of 49 mln dlrs. In the year, chemicals and plastics earned 472 mln dlrs against losses of 142 mln dlrs in 1985.     Operating income at industrial gases rose to 64 mln dlrs from 55 mln in the quarter and to 276 mln dlrs from 222 mln in the year.     The company's specialties and services segment cut its losses in the quarter to 13 mln dlrs from 40 mln dlrs and in the year to three mln dlrs from 181 mln dlrs.     Eliminations of business conducted between the company's industry segments contributed two mln dlrs to fourth quarter 1985 profits but did not affect the 1986 quarter. The eliminations caused losses of three mln dlrs compared to six mln dlrs in the year.     The 1985 operating results include a host of unusual writeoffs and depreciation charges totaling 134 mln dlrs in the quarter and 906 mln dlrs in the year.     Capital expenditures rose to 524 mln dlrs in 1986 from 501 mln dlrs.     By segment, spending at carbon products fell to 42 mln dlrs from 57 mln dlrs and spending fell at specialties and services to 126 mln dlrs from 143 mln dlrs.     At chemicals and plastics, expenditures rose to 147 mln dlrs from 133 mln and at industrial gases they rose to 209 mln dlrs from 168 mln dlrs.     The company's cash and equivalents fell to 299 mln dlrs at year end from 430 mln dlrs at year end 1985, after a net decrease of 131 mln dlrs during 1986.

Delegates from the National Pork Producers Council, NPPC, attending the American Pork Congress in Indianapolis, voted overwhelmingly to recommend the U.S. congress not to change the farm bill.

Other members said the farm bill has some imperfections but that's a price pork producers are willing to pay for legislative stability, an NPPC spokesman said.

In comments on its Export Sales Report, the department said sales of 1.0 mln tonnes to the USSR -- previously reported under the daily reporting system -- were the first sales for delivery to the USSR under the fourth year of the U.S.-USSR Grains Supply Agreement, which began October 1.     Japan added 689,700 tonnes to previous purchases and sales to unknown destinations rose by 429,800 tonnes.

Major increases were for Belgium, South Korea, Mexico and Italy, it said.     Soybean cake and meal sales of 103,700 tonnes were 2-3/4 times the previous week's marketing year low, but six pct less than the four week average.     Major increases for West Germany, Belgium, Spain, Italy and Australia were partially offset by declines to unknown destinations.

The sharp fall in international coffee prices will not affect Colombia's external credit situation, finance minister Cesar Gaviria told reuters.

Colombia, the only major latin american country not to have rescheduled its external public debt, has a total foreign debt of 13.6 billion dlrs.     Calls for a rescheduling of the debt have come this week from the opposition conservative party and the biggest trade union following the coffee price drop. Gaviria said lower coffee prices this year could mean a loss of 1.5 billion dlrs in revenues for 1987.

acq	HUGHES &lt;HT> CHANGES STANCE ON MERGER AFTER SUIT .  A one billion dlr lawsuit pushed Hughes Tool Co into an about-face on its rejection of a proposed merger with Baker International Corp &lt;BKO>, Wall Street analysts said.     Last night, Hughes said the planned merger with Baker was off. Baker then filed a suit seeking punitive damages from Hughes for calling off the merger. At midday today Hughes said it was still interested in the merger.     The analysts also said Hughes may be worried that its troubles could make it a takeover candidate.     There was speculation today that Harold Simmons, the Dallas investor, might try to acquire Hughes, but Simmons told Reuters he is not interested.     Simmons said he intends to file a 13-D with the Securities and Exchange Monday reporting a stake of five pct or more in some publicly traded company. He declined to identify the target other than to rule out Hughes.     One analyst said another factor in the latest Hughes turnabout was Borg-Warner Corp &lt;BOR>, which owns 18.5 pct of Hughes. Borg-Warner ex-chairman J.F. Bere, who serves on the Hughes board, is believed to favor the merger with Baker.     Despite the Hughes statement that it is interested in a merger, and Baker's response that a merger is still possibile, analysts said no one could be certain where the situation was going.     "I think the merger is not going through," said Phil Pace, analyst at Kidder, Peabody and Co. He said the merger "lost a lot of its appeal" when the U.S. Department of Justice required that Baker sell off its Reed Tool Co operation.     Although the Reed operation is relatively small in view of the total size of a combined Baker-Hughes, Pace said "30 to 40 pct of the cost savings are tied up in that."     "They (Hughes) are obviously concerned about the lawsuit," said James Crandell, analyst at Salomon Brothers Inc. "Apparently they are willing to continue discussions but whether they will alter their position, I don't know.     "It's getting a little confusing," said James Carroll, analyst at PaineWebber Group Inc. He said the arguments cited by Hughes yesterday for not doing the merger "tend to be weak." Hughes said yesterday that as a condition of the merger it wanted Reed Tool and other businesses sold prior to April 22, the projected merger date. A government decree allowed a longer period of time.     Hughes contended it was better to formally combine the companies with the status of Reed already settled. Baker apparently sees no reason to speed up the sale.     Carroll said Baker had previously estimated 110 to 130 mln dlrs in savings if the companies were combined without selling Reed. But he said Baker now thinks 75 to 85 mln dlrs will be saved while Hughes sees a saving of only 50 to 60 mln dlrs.     Carroll also noted that since the merger accord was first signed "the outlook for the industry has improved materially." Hughes may simply feel the pressure on the oil service industry is lifting.

Terms were not disclosed. Armtek spokesman John Sievers said S and A is a 50 mln dlr business.     Earlier this week, Armtek announced the sale of its industrial tire and assembly business division to Dyneer Corp of Scotsdale, Ariz.     Cash proceeds from both sales will be used to reduce outstanding debt.      Under a long term supply agreement with Condere, it is anticipated that truck tires produced at the Natchez plant will be supplied to the Armstrong Tire Co, an Armtek operating company, the company said.

The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued a proposed policy statement for the  recovery of take-or-pay costs imposed by existing natural gas contracts between producers and pipelines.     It put out the statement, by 5-0 vote, for a 30-day comment period. It also put out an alternative policy statement by Commissioner Charles Stalon.     FERC said in a press release that "the proposed policy statement estblishes an exception to the commission's general policy that take-or-pay buy-out and buy-down costs must be recovered through pipeline' commodity sales rates."     FERC added that "specifically, in cases where pipelines assume an equitable share of buy-out or buy-down costs, the commission proposes to permit the pipelines to recover the remaining costs through their demand rates."     It said it wanted guidelines for buying out and reforming existing contracts to help spread the impact of these take-or-pay costs in a responsible, fair and equitable way.     Commission chairwoman Martha Hesse said "this proposal represents the commission's sincere attempt to help the industry through this difficult period of transition to a more competitive market."     Hesse said "it is my hope that our proposed policy will encourage and guide the timely resolution of take-or-pay contractual disputes that have impeded the industry's transition to a more competitive environment.  It is vital to the industry that we get this problem behind us."  reuter &#3;

Alpha Health Systems Corp, a wholly-owned subsidiary of Pesch and Co, said it submitted a merger proposal to the board of REPH Acquisition Co, the parent company of Republic Health Corp, which is 64 pct owned by Pesch interests.     The balance of REPH's common stock is owned by members of Republic management, McDonnell Douglas Corp &lt;MD>, Donaldson, Lufkin and Jenrette and Pacific Asset Holdings L.P.     Republic currently owns 44 hospitals and manages 46 other facilities, in 25 states.     Details of the proposal were not disclosed.  Company representatives were not immediately available.     The proposal provides that REPH would become a wholly-owned subsidiary of Alpha and that the existing REPH common stockholders would become stockholders of Alpha, it said.     REPH's board has appointed a special committee to negotiate terms of the proposed merger, Pesch said.     Last year, Republic was acquired by REPH in a leveraged buyout transaction led by Dr. LeRoy Pesch, the principal shareholder of Pesch and Co.

It also forecast higher 1987 sales due to an increased order backlog. Revenues last year fell to 191 mln dlrs from 223.3 mln while profit fell to 4.4 mln dlrs from 13.1 mln.     Spar added that lower development costs in the communications group and a return to normal operations in gears and transmissions and aviation services "will remove a serious drain on profits" this year.     It attributed its reduced 1986 earnings to communications group losses resulting from continued heavy investment in new products and market development, a four-month strike at its Toronto plants and delays in receipt of authorization from customers to start work on new programs.

acq	CHEMLAWN &lt;CHEM> REJECTS WASTE'S &lt;WMX> OFFER .  ChemLawn Corp said its board rejected Waste Management Inc's 27 dlr-per-share tender offer and urged its shareholders not to tender their shares.     ChemLawn said its board asked management and its financial advisor, Smith Barney, Harris Upham And Co Inc, to seek other purchasers of the company to maximize shareholder value.     ChemLawn also said it adopted a shareholder rights plan, or "poison pill," during a 120-intermin safeguard period its board adopted to deter attempts to acquire the company through any means other than an all-cash tender offer while it seeks other purchasers.     ChemLawn also said it began litigation against Waste Management in federal court in Columbus, seeking injunctive and other relief.     The suit alleges, among other things, that certain Waste Management officers and directors purchased ChemLawn's stock before making the tender offer. ChemLawn claimed such purchases possibly violated the officers' fiduciary duties and the Securities and Exchange Commission's insider trading rules.     Last week, Waste Management made a tender offer to acquire ChemLawn for 27 dlrs per share or 270 mln dlrs.     ChemLawn said its board was determined that Waste's offer was inadequate and not in the best interest of shareholders, and could "adversely affect" the interests of its employees, suppliers, creditors, and customers.     "Our board carefully reviewed Waste Management offer and concluded that it does not fully reflect the value of the company. We strongly urge our shareholders not to tender their shares to Waste Management," said Chairman L. Jack Van Fossen.     ChemLawn said its rights plan is designed to protect shareholders against abusive tactics, such as "market accumulations by Waste Management or others."     Under the plan, one comon stock purchase right will be distributed as a dividend on each outstanding share of ChemLawn common.     ChemLawn said its rights holders can buy a share of its common for one dlr if any entity acquires 25 pct or more of its commmon, other than by an all cash tender offer for all its shares or an approved acquisition agreement by its board.     It said the rights expire July three 1987, or 60 days after they become exercisable if later than that date. It said its board may redeem the rights for five cts per right any time prior to their exercise date.     ChemLawn said the plan will not be triggered by purchases purusant to Waste Management's present tender offer.     It said the dividend will be paid to shareholders of record March 20.  Reuter &#3;

According to the letter of intent signed by the companies, ConAgra will acquire all of Monfort's 4.3 mln outstanding shares for 10.75 mln of its own shares.     Based on ConAgra's closing price of 34 dlrs today, the transaction is worth about 356.5 mln dlrs. The merger is expected to be completed in June, they said.     The companies said the acquisition will result in a restatement of ConAgra's earnings for the fiscal year ending May 31, but the restatement is not expected to materially change the previously reported, or upcoming, fiscal year-end earnings. In fiscal 1986, ConAgra had net income of 105.3 mln dlrs on sales of 5.9 billion dlrs.     For its fiscal year ending August 1986, Monfort reported 25.1 mln dlrs in earnings on sales of 1.6 billion dlrs. The company is one of the largest lamb and beef producers in the U.S., producing, transporting and selling the products domestically and internationally.  Reuter &#3;
grain,wheat	HOUSE 0/92 PLAN SEEN SCALED-BACK TO 1987 WHEAT .  Key members of the House Agriculture committee have agreed to scale-back the 0/92 provision of a pending disaster aid bill to cover only 1987 crop wheat, but a broader 0/92 proposal is likely to be resurrected later, Congressional sources said.     The sources said key lawmakers including Reps. Glenn English (D-Okla.), and Dan Glickman (D-Kan.) agreed to support an amendment to be offered next week by Rep. Charles Stenholm (D-Tex.) which would limit 0/92 only to producers of 1987 crop winter and spring wheat.     This would scale-back the 0/92 provision to the original proposal by English allowing a pilot 0/92 program for 1987 wheat only. That provision was later broadened by the subcommittee to include 1988 crop winter wheat.     Under 0/92, a farmer can forego planting a crop but still collect 92 pct of deficiency payments.     Earlier today, the House Agriculture committee postponed until next Tuesday a meeting to consider the disaster aid bill and 0/92.     The agreement to limit 0/92 to a wheat pilot program follows vocal criticism of the proposal by some influential farm groups who are concerned about the major impact of 0/92, and by members of Congress wary of reopening the farm bill.     Congressional sources said there has not been enough time to study the implications of a broad 0/92.     "The timing (of the proposal) is off," said one aide to a House Agriculture committee member.     However, several Congressional sources said they expect a broader 0/92 provision to emerge again when the House Agriculture committee is faced next month with the need to make spending cuts in the agriculture budget for fiscal 1988 as part of an overall deficit reduction package.     Gene Moos, aide to House Majority leader Tom Foley (D-Wash.), predicted agriculture's share of budget cuts may exceed one billion dlrs.     A broader 0/92 might be resurrected later because both the Congressional Budget Office and the Reagan administration estimate it would result in significant budget savings.     A U.S. Agriculture Department official said 0/92 for all 1987 crops would save 300 to 400 mln dlrs and more than 1.5 billion dlrs over five years.     Another factor which could affect the 0/92 debate is the approach of planting season, Congressional sources said.     Some officials said it already is late for implementation of a 0/92 in 1987 because farm program signup ends March 31 for wheat and feedgrains.     If Congress approved 0/92 later in the year sign-up either would have to be extended or reopened, sources said.  Reuter &#3;
trade,crude,nat-gas	FAVORED TRADE STATUS FOR MOSCOW STILL OPPOSED .  The Reagan administration wants to encourage expanded trade with the Soviet Union but does not believe Moscow yet warrants most-favored-nation treatment, Deputy Secretary of State John Whitehead said.     "It seems to me that more trade between us is better than less trade," he told a forum on U.S.-Soviet trade relations.     To that end, the administration in January allowed foreign policy controls on the export of oil and gas equipment to the Soviet Union to lapse, he said.     Also, Washington and its allies are reviewing remaining export controls in hopes of simplifying the list of prohibited items and speeding up the licensing process, he said.     Whitehead said, however, the prefential treatment that comes with most-favored-nation status is out for the moment.     U.S. law prohibits most-favored-nation status for countries that restrict emigration and other rights.     "What we have seen so far (in improved rights under Soviet Leader Mikhail Gorbachev) are promising trends," he said.     But, he added: "We don't know if they will continue, we don't know how significant they will be."  Reuter &#3;

The company also reached agreements in principle for an 8.1 mln dlr settlement of class action law suits.     About 2.9 mln dlrs of the class action settlement will be provided by Paradyne's insurance carrier. The settlement is contingent on court approval after notice to class members, it said.      The criminal case settlement dismisses all charges including bribery and false statement, except for conspiracy to which Paradyne pleaded guilty.     The criminal settlement includes the lifting of the government's suspension, the dismissal of the federal civil false claims suit and all charges against the individuals.     Of the 2.9 mln dlrs the insurance carrier will provide for the civil settlement, 750,000 dlrs will go to settle a derivative lawsuit.     For the year ended December 31, Paradyne reported a net loss of 38.5 mln dlrs. The year-end results include an 8.0 mln dlrs provision for future legal and or settlement costs to cover the civil and criminal settlements announced today.     Paradyne also said it named Jerry Kendall as president and chief executive officer, succeeding Robert Wiggins who resigned as chairman and chief executive officer as part of the settlement of the indictment.     Kendall formerly served as executive vice president and chief operating officer.     The company also said that due to the sluggish marketplace, it does not expect to be profitable in the first quarter but is optimistic about the outlook for the year.     For the first quarter of 1986, the company reported net income of 875,000 dlrs on sales of 66.0 mln dlrs.     Wiggins was among five Paradyine executives who were charged along with three former officers in a 1985 federal indictment stemming from a 115 mln contract awarded to Paradyne in 1981 to build a computer network for the Social Security Administration.     The men were accused of conspiring to bribe government officials and defaud the Social Security Administration. Wiggins and other defendants were also charged with providing false testimony and obstructing justice during a Securities and Exchange Commission investigation.      Under the settlement announced today, federal prosecutors agreed to defer all charges against Wiggins and three other defendants under a one-year pretrial agreement.     The charges would then be dropped if the defendants successfully complete the probation period. Details of the requirements in the agreement were not immediately available.             Reuter &#3;

coffee,oilseed,soybean,trade,sugar,cocoa	BRAZIL DEBT SEEN PARTNER TO HARD SELL TACTICS .  Brazil's recent announcement of a suspension in interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign debt gave the banking system the jitters and confirmed views among many international economists and commodities analysts that Brazil will continue to flex its trading muscles in 1987.     The developing world's most indebted nation is also its most prolific exporter of agricultural commodities such as coffee and soybeans, and might maximize foreign exchange revenue by selling hard on world markets, economists said.     "That sounds like a reasonable strategy. But there is no way they can trade their way out of this situation," Aldo Roldan, Vice President for International Services at Chase Econometrics, said.     Roldan told Reuters that Brazil not only had to tackle the problems of satisfying domestic demand and competing on glutted world markets, but also had to work to make its position on foreign exchange markets more profitable.     "Domestic costs have increased (due to inflation) and exporters have not had the same offsetting movement in exchange rates," Roldan said.     The Chase economist also said commodities markets were depressed and generally did not appear very promising for a country like Brazil, where pure commodities account for some 50 pct of exports and in 1986 had a total value of around 23 billion dlrs.     But he added: "They are always pretty aggressive and they have good foreign marketing channels."     Analysts said a key factor in Brazilian trade will be coffee, and even without background pressure from foreign creditors the world's largest producer was expected to hit the market this year with a vengeance.     Negotiations between International Coffee Organization (ICO) members to re-establish producer export quotas broke up earlier this week with major producers and consumers accusing each other of intransigence.     "Brazil would not tolerate a change in ICO regulations, which others wanted changed," one senior coffee dealer said.     The dealer, who declined to be named, said Brazil wanted to preserve its market share. At the end of the talks, he said Brazil hinted it could sell more than anyone else and others would suffer.     Brazil will be an aggressive seller under any scenario but as yet there is no sign of unusually heavy Brazilian sales, the dealer said.     "If they do come into the market at this level it will go lower and you could breach a dollar, ninety or eighty cents," he said.     New York coffee futures for May delivery settled 2.29 cents lower Thursday at 104.68 cents a lb, while more distant deliveries fell the six-cent maximum trading limit.     President of the Brazilian Coffee Institute, Jorio Dauster told a press conference in Rio de Janeiro today that Brazil has no set target for its coffee exports following the breakdown of the ICO talks on export quotas.     Many economists and analysts believe soybeans could be the focus of possible stepped-up Brazilian marketing efforts. "They will be more aggressive this year than they have ever been," according to Richard Loewy, analyst for Prudential-Bache Securities Inc.     Loewy believes the foreign debt problem, a good crop, plus difficulties with storage would help motivate selling of the Brazil soybean crop. "Brazilian farmers also need cash flow and they can't afford to store the crops," he said.     The Chicago soybean complex has been nervous for some time about large South American crops developing under near ideal conditions towards record yields.     "We are going to see a very rapid decline, earlier than usual, this year in our (U.S.) exports," Loewy said.     Tommy Eshleman, economist for the American Soybean Association (ASA), said this year's Brazilian soybean harvest could total 18 mln tonnes, versus 13.7 mln last year.     Marketings will be very aggressive this summer when prices are usually high relative to the rest of the year due to the vulnerability of the U.S. crop to bad growing weather.     Another incentive to sell might be trade anticipation of a reduction in the U.S. government soybean loan rate, offered to farmers who give crops as collateral, Eshleman said.     He said there has been some uncertainty this year about the soybean loan rate, which acts as an effective floor for prices by keeping supplies away from the free market. Farmers can forfeit their beans to the government rather than repay the loan.     "We're getting into a period when they (Brazil) are starting to harvest and starting to export," Eshleman said. But he added it will be a while before U.S. exports fall to below 10 mln bushels a week from around 20 mln bushels currently.     Jose Melicias from the research department of Drexel Burnham Lambert said Brazil would be trying to export as much as it can this year because of its economic situation.     He said the debt situation was a major consideration. "The Brazilian government also does not have enough money to pay for storage," he added.     Asked if a return to an inflationary environment in Brazil would make farmers inclined to hold onto crops, Melicias said it would not make a big difference.     On other commodity markets, Brazil's selling impact may be muted no matter its need to generate capital.     Brazil is faced with a poor 1986/87 sugar harvest, which could limit exports to the world market, analysts said. The country may have oversold and be unable to honor export commitments, and this plus higher domestic demand caused by consumer price subsidies on ethanol and refined sugar, will give it little room to stretch exports, they said.     Brazil's other major crop, cocoa, is in its third year of surplus. "Cocoa consumption is basically flat and last year it fell, so I don't think they can start throwing out cocoa and find many more markets for it," one analyst said.     "If they come out as aggressive sellers, the market would collapse and they can't afford to do that," she added.  Reuter &#3;
crude	IEA SAYS OPEC FEBRUARY CRUDE OUTPUT 16.1 MLN BPD .  OPEC produced an average 16.1 mln barrels per day (bpd) of crude oil in February, down from 16.5 mln the previous month and an overall 17.3 mln bpd in fourth quarter 1986, the International Energy Agency said.     A few OPEC countries last month exceeded the production quotas set at their last conference in December, but liftings were reduced from several countries, it said in its latest monthly oil market report.     These cutbacks were due in part to buyer resistance to fixed prices, introduced from February 1, particularly for fixed volumes over an extended period.

Contracts for Saudi crude have been signed, but it is understood they have much leeway in required liftings.     The report said the reduction in Iraqi air attacks on Iranian export facilities allowed Iran's output to reach 2.2 mln bpd in January, but buyer resistance to fixed prices apparently cut February production.     It said Iraqi exports are about 1.0 mln bpd through the Turkish pipeline, 0.1-0.2 mln by truck through Jordan and 0.2-0.3 mln via the Saudi pipeline to Yanbu. Internal consumption is some 0.3 mln bpd.     The IEA estimated total non-communist world oil supply in February at 45.0 mln bpd, down from 45.4 mln in January and 47.0 mln in the fourth quarter.     The February world supply figure is made up of 16.1 mln bpd OPEC crude production, 1.4 mln bpd OPEC natural gas liquids (ngls), 16.6 mln bpd OECD crude and ngls, 8.3 mln bpd other developing countries' crude and ngls, net trade of 1.1 mln bpd with centrally planned economies, 0.5 mln bpd of non-conventional crudes (such as tar sands and oil from coal) and 1.0 mln bpd from processiing gains.     Within the OECD, preliminary Norwegian data show record 1.06 mln bpd output in January, with lower production expected in February in accordance with government curtailments of approximately 80,000 bpd, announced in support of OPEC.

An investor group led by members of the Hunt family of Dallas, Texas, told the Securities and Exchange Commission it has acquired a 6.2 pct stake in Comdata Network Inc &lt;CDN> and may try to influence company policy.     The investor group, led by Rosewood Financial Inc, said it opposes a company recapitalization plan worked out between Comdata and Mason Best Co, a Texas investment firm, which last reported holding about 9.5 pct of the company's stock.     The Hunt group said it offered on March 3 to buy the entire 5.3 pct stake held by dissident shareholder Donald Carter at 14 dlrs each, but has received no reply as of yesterday.     Rosewood, which is owned by the Caroline Hunt Trust Estate, whose trustees include Margaret Hunt Hill, also said it has notified the Federal Trade Commission of its intent to buy between 15 and 25 pct of Comdata's common stock.     Under federal law, it cannot buy more than 15 pct of Comdata's stock until a 15 to 30 day waiting period is over, unless the FTC gives it early approval.     Under the proposed Comdata recapitalization plan, the company would buy up to 10 mln of its common shares at 13.25 dlrs each.     Mason Best, which belongs to CNI Parnters, a Texas partnership, would not tender any of its stake under the plan, but would instead buy another one mln Comdata common shares and would get representation on the company's board.     The Hunt group said it has told Comdata that it considers required payments under the plan, such as a 1.5 mln dlr fee and the issuance of a warrant to buy 500,000 common shares to be a waste of the company's assets.

The walkout by Brazil's 40,000 seamen has idled 160 ships in various ports, Jorge Luis Leao Franco, a senior official of the National Merchant Marine Union, told Reuters.     The strikers, who are seeking a 275 pct pay increase, have rejected offers of a 100 pct raise from the state oil company Petrobras and an 80 pct increase from the National Union of Maritime Navigation Companies (Syndarma).     Leao Franco said eight hours of talks in Rio de Janeiro with Labor Minister Almir Pazzianotto ended today without resolving the dispute.     He said six ships were idle abroad -- in the Netherlands, Spain, Venezuela, France and South Africa.     Economic analysts said the strike was of major concern to the government, which has suspended interest payments on part of Brazil's foreign debt following a drastic deterioration in the country's trade balance.     The head of the National Merchant Marine Authority, Murilo Rubens Habbema, was quoted today as saying that if the strike continued foreign ships could be authorized to transport Brazilian exports.

TWA vice president and general counsel Mark Buckstein said TWA also sought a declaratory judgement from the court that its 52 dlr per share takeover offer for USAir would in no way interfer with USAir's possible buyout of Peidmont Aviation Inc &lt;PIE>.     Buckstein said TWA asked the court to enjoin the enforcement of USAir's shareholder rights plan, or "poison pill." Such provisions, which typically allow for the issue of securities to shareholders in the event of a hostile takeover bid, are aimed at deterring takeovers by making them more expensive.     USAir earlier today rejected TWA's offer, saying TWA's bid was an attempt to interfer with its buyout of Piedmont.     USAir also had said its counsel would investigate the matter. Tonight, a spokesman for USAir said the airline had no comment on TWA's lawsuit.     USAir did respond, however, to a TWA request to the Department of Transportation for permission to buy up to 51 pct of USAir stock and place the stock in a voting trust pending approval of a takeover.     USAir said the request was "hastily pasted together in order to take advantage of a regulatory anamoly that would allow TWA to accomplish in a regulated environment actions that would be impermissable in the non-regulated economy at large."

coffee	COSTA RICA OPTIMISTIC ABOUT REFORMING ICO .  Costa Rica's economy minister said he sees new hope for winning changes in the International Coffee Organisation system of export quotas.     Minister Luis Diego Escalante, who serves as president of the Costa Rican Coffee Institute, said he was hopeful because of the support offered Costa Rica and other smaller producing- nations by such major consumers as the United States, Britain and the Netherlands at last week's ICO meeting in london.     Escalante told a news conference here he "carried the weight of the negotiations" at the meeting by calling for larger export quotas for the smaller coffee-growing nations.     Costa rica is insisting, Escalante said, on a new quota system based on a producing nation's real export capacity, once it has satisfied internal demand.     "There are countries such as our own whose sales possibilities are close to or above 100 pct of their current quotas," Escalante said.     At the same time, there are countries favoured by the current system that have been assigned quotas far above their export potential, he said.     The current ICO quota system is "unfair and autocratic," Escalante said.     Escalante attributed the nosedive in international coffee prices over the last week to speculation rather than real matters of supply and demand.     "Be careful," he warned, "there's not as much coffee in the world as they say. What there is are bags of sawdust."  Reuter &#3;
money-supply	U.S. MONEY GROWTH SLOWS SHARPLY, ECONOMISTS SAY .  U.S. money supply growth is slowing down rapidly, and some economists believe that all three of the Federal Reserve's main monetary aggregates may even have contracted in February.     A contraction is unlikely to be a major concern for the Fed, especially as it would follow a long period of torrid growth, but it could give the central bank extra leeway in the weeks ahead if it decided that a relaxation of monetary policy was justified on account of weakness in the economy.         M-1 money supply for the week ended February 23, reported today, rose 1.9 billion dlrs to 738.5 billion, but preliminary forecasts call for a drop next week of around two billion dlrs. The monthly average in January was 737.1 billion dlrs.     M-1 makes up about a quarter of M-2 and a fifth of M-3. With other components of M-2, such as money-market deposit accounts and small time deposits, also falling, the stage is set for falls in the broader aggregates too, economists say.     M-1 has been largely discredited because its traditional link to economic growth has disintegrated under the impact of falling interest rates and banking deregulation.     But the consistent behavior of all three aggregates is likely to impress the Fed, said Ward McCarthy of Merrill Lynch Economics Inc.     "The Fed has confidence in the aggregates when they're all sending the same signal. This is going to raise some eyebrows at the Fed," McCarthy said.     Stephen Slifer of Shearson Lehman Brothers Inc added, "We have some very good-looking monetary aggregate data. It's coming in a lot weaker than I thought."         The economists were quick to caution that one month's data prove nothing, especially because money growth previously had been so rapid. M-1 in the last 52 weeks has grown at a 16.7 pct rate and at a 19.1 pct rate in the past 13 weeks.     Moreover, some of the contraction in M-2 can probably be explained by a shift of funds from savings vehicles into the booming stock market and is thus not an indication of a slowdown in the business expansion.     But the data raise the tantalizing possibility for the bond markets that the slowdown in money growth is partly a reflection of a weaker economy that needs more Fed stimulus.     McCarthy noted that the slower money growth coincides with signs that the economy is losing momentum as the quarter progresses. "Some of the economic indicators are not as rosy as they were a month ago," he noted.     He expects only five to six pct M-1 growth in March and rises in M-2 and M-3 of about four pct.     Slifer sees stronger growth of 10 pct in M-1 and five pct or less for M-2 and M-3, but the rates would still be moderate enough to encourage the Fed to ease policy if gross national product for the first quarter proved to be weak. "You'd certainly be more inclined to ease than you would in the past."     There was certainly nothing in the Fed's latest balance sheet, however, to suggest a change of policy is already under way, economists said. Discount window borrowings were in line with expectations at 233 mln dlrs a day.     Robert Brusca of Nikko Securities Co International Inc argued that an easier Fed policy is unlikely to do much to solve America's most urgent economic problem, its massive trade deficit. Because of the possibility that further dollar depreciation - and thus rising inflation - may be needed to close the trade gap, Brusca said "I'm not prepared to be all that optimistic about the bond market."

Re-exports fell by 6.6 pct, resulting in a surge in net imports from 175,901 to 251,708 tonnes, an increase of 43 pct.     Total West German consumption was estimated at around a high 287,000 tonnes, largely reflecting attractive prices. The sources, however, could not give comparative figures for 1985.     South American producer countries supplied 97 pct of West German requirements, with Chile shipping 229,176 tonnes (1985 - 182,959) and Peru 210,513 (147,014) tonnes.

U.K. Officials are studying the possible link between the use of antibiotics in calf feeds and the spread of drug-resistant strains of salmonella in humans, a Ministry of Agriculture official said.     A study published in the New England Journal of Medicine yesterday stated that the spread of an unusual strain of salmonella that is resistant to the drug chloramphenicol had been shown to be linked to farms that used the drug to promote the growth of cattle.    The U.K. Ministry of Agriculture is working with the Department of Health and the Public Health Laboratory to investigate the whole subject of resistant strains of salmonella.     "The Ministry of Agriculture is concerned about the possible effects on human and animal health," the official said. The government is also studying a recommendation from the Farm Animal Welfare Council (FAWC) to restrict the trade of calves under 56 days old through markets. The FAWC says this would help reduce the spread of salmonella.  Reuter &#3;

Reaffirming remarks made last year by chairman Howard Macdonald, Annesley said the company is considering selling its stake in Dome Mines.     Concerning Dome Petroleum's 42 pct stake in &lt;Encor Energy Corp Ltd>, Annesley said "Encor is a strategic investment for Dome, and we have no intention of selling it."     Dome spokesman Annesley said in answer to a question that he was not aware of any negotiations now under way toward the sale of Dome Petroleum's 20.9 mln Dome Mines shares.     He also declined to specify at what price the company would consider selling it shares.     "Clearly today's prices of more than 15 dlrs a share (of Dome Mines stock) are very attractive," Annesley commented.     "We were considering the sale 'at the right price' at a time when the shares were priced around nine to 10 dlrs," he added. A price of around 15 dlrs a share would be considered "fairly attractive," Annesley said.     Annesley also Dome Petroleum may be able to sell its Dome Mines' shares at a premium to market prices. "There might be an opportunity to pick up a premium on that because it would be virtually a control block in Dome Mines," he said.     Dome Mines shares traded earlier at 15-1/4 dlrs, off 1/4 on the Toronto Stock Exchange.     Dome Petroleum is now negotiating a plan to restructure debt of more than 6.1 billion Canadian dlrs with a group of 56 major creditors, which includes Dome Mines and Encor Energy.

jobs,ipi,gnp,income,trade,retail	FEBRUARY U.S. JOBS GAINS SHOW STRONGER ECONOMY .  Momentum in th U.S. economy may be picking up given solid across-the board increases in the February U.S. employment report, economists said.     U.S. non-farm payroll employment rose 337,000 in February, twice what the financial markets expected. This follows a 319,000 gain in January, revised down from a previously reported 448,000 increase.     "Even if you look at January and February together, this is still a much stronger report than the consensus expectation in the market," said Allan Leslie of Discount Corporation.     Economists stressed that gains in hours worked signal much larger gains in February U.S. production and income than previously forecast.     The average work week rose 0.2 hours to 35.0 hours from 34.8 hours in January. The average manufacturing work week rose 0.3 hours to 41.2 hours, the longest factory work week since November 1966, the Commerce Department said.     "The gains in manufacturing employment point to a very large increase in industrial production of between 0.5 and 0.7 pct," said Joe Carson of Chemical Bank. This compares to a 0.4 pct  gain in January U.S. industrial production.     Peter Greenbaum of Smith Barney Harris Upham and Co Inc noted that the average wage rate increased to 8.87 dlrs an hour in February from 8.83 dlrs in January.     "Combined with the increase in hours worked, this means we'll get a pretty healthy gain in personal income vis-a-vis the wage and salary disbursement," he said.     Greenbaum said that February U.S. personal income should rise at least 0.5 pct after being flat in January.     He said the February employment gains are consistent with his firm's first quarter U.S. real gross national product growth forecast of 3.7 pct.     Economists agreed that the employment data were negative for the credit markets in that they signal a healthier economy and no easing in the Federal Reserve's monetary policy. But most said that the market need not fear tighter policy either.     "This report is another reason for the Fed to not consider easing," said Ray Stone of Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Inc.     "It gives them more room to address the dollar situation," he said. "If they had to nudge policy tighter, they could do so, but it's most likely they'll sit and wait."     "The data have not been uniform," Stone added. "Durable goods were weak in January and now employment is strong."     In January, U.S. durable goods orders dropped 7.5 pct, followed by a 4.0 pct drop in U.S. factory goods orders. U.S. retail sales fell 5.8 pct, and the U.S. merchandise trade gap widened to 14.8 billion dlrs.     "Things just aren't adding up," said Steve Slifer of Lehman Goverment Securities Inc. "Consumer spending, capital spending, goverment spending, and net exports data show very weak first quarter GNP growth of one pct," he said.     "The employment and production data point to a big inventory build-up, but that's what we thought in the fourth quarter and we only got 1.3 pct GNP growth."     Manufacturing employment gained 50,000 after falling 15,000 in January. Economists estimated that 30,000 of the gain was accounted for by striking workers in the steel and machinery industries returning to work.     Even so, some economists said that the manufacturing gains have resulted from an improving trade outlook.     Jason Benderly of Goldman, Sachs and Co noted that the U.S. trade picture improved in the fourth quarter as net exports grew at a 20 pct annual rate while the rate of increase in imports fell to only six pct, and that it continues to improve in the first quarter.     "Not only the official statistics for the fourth quarter, but evidence of a pick up in orders from overseas for paper products, chemicals, high-tech goods, and capital goods show that trade is improving," Benderley said.     "The economy is moving between extremes," he said. "Some reports are going to look bad and some good, but first quarter GNP is going to grow in the middle at about three pct."     A 287,000 gain in services employment comprised the greater part of February's employment gain. Retail services employment rose 129,000 in February, compared to a gain of 117,000 in January, previously reported at 166,000.     Construction employment rose a slim 2,000 in February. But this follows a robust 113,000 gain in January, revised down from a previously reported 142,000 gain.     The U.S. civilian unemployment rate was unchanged in February at 6.7 pct. This means the jobless rate has stayed at 6.7 pct for three consecutive months, the lowest reading since March 1980, the Commerce Department noted.     "The Federal Reserve has to be pleased with this report," Carson said. "This takes away the Fed's flexibility to ease, but there's no reason to tighten. It's way too early for that."

Treasury Secretary James Baker said the agreement among industrial nations in Paris last month is only a start in Washington's drive to intensify economic cooperation among leading countries.

He added "we see our role as a steward of a process in which we sit down with our industrial allies to find ways to promote more balanced international growth."     The Paris agreements called trade surplus countries to strengthen their growth and on the U.S. to reduce its budget deficit. Under such circumstances, the countries agreed their currencies were within ranges broadly consistent with economic fundamentals.

This remark caused the dollar to drop as it appeared to conflict with a recent agreement in Paris by the United States and five other industrial nations that currency rates were at about the right level to reflect underlying economic conditions.

The ICC had rejected in July the merger of the Santa Fe and Southern Pacific Railroads on the grounds that it would reduce competition.     Santa Fe in its petition outlines an array of pro-competitive agreements with other railroads which would preserve the economic benefits of the merger for the merged railroad and the public.     If the commission agrees that public benefits and competitive enhancements will result, it can vote to reopen the merger case. Interested parties have until March 25 to file statements in response to the supplemental petition.  Reuter &#3;

acq	NORDBANKEN TO AUCTION ITS FERMENTA SHARES .  Sweden's &lt;Nordbanken> banking group said it would sell the 4.2 mln B free shares deposited as loan collateral by Fermenta AB's &lt;FRMS.ST> founder and former chief executive Refaat el-Sayed and it planned to buy them up itself.     The bank said the sale - by public auction on March 16 -- was because of a debtor's inability to repay an overdue loan.     The B free shares closed at 16.50 crowns on the bourse's unofficial list -- down from a peak of 300 in January 1986. Nordbanken said it did not exclude accepting a suitable bid for the shares although it expected to buy them back itself.     The statement said the sale did not represent any withdrawal from Nordbanken's undertakings towards the Fermenta group and that it had been sanctioned by the other main shareholders.     Nordbanken is Fermenta's third largest creditor with loans of 155 mln crowns. It was one of the four Swedish banks which last month agreed to advance the group 110 mln crowns to solve its immediate liquidity problems. Together with two other main shareholders, it also advanced Fermenta an additional 65 mln crowns until a new equity issue could be made.     Fermenta is due to hold an extraordinary shareholders' meeting on Tuesday to approve the planned equity issue.     Nordbanken had to make a provision against a 200 mln crown loan to el-Sayed in its 1986 results.     Fermenta's new management originally hoped to raise 160 mln crowns through the new one for four rights issue and an extra 170 mln from an issue to Nordbanken, another major creditor and shareholder &lt;Gotabanken> and the group's new majority owner &lt;Industrivarden AB>.     The share price was to be 20 crowns. But there has been doubt over the plans since the stock fell below this level this week after Fermenta's former chairman Kjell Brandstrom said the company was in a much worse state than he thought.

interest,money-fx	FRENCH PRIMARY BOND MARKET SHOWS NEW SPARKLE .  The French primary bond market is showing signs of renewed effervescence after several weeks of lethargy and the trend is expected to continue if hopes of imminent interest rate cuts are fulfilled, market operators said.     The Bank of France is generally expected to give a signal to the market, possibly at the beginning of next week, by announcing a quarter point cut in its intervention rate, which has stood at eight pct since January 2, or in its seven-day repurchase rate, set at 8-3/4 pct since January 5.     The central bank's averaged-out day to day call money rate, the reference rate for interbank money market operators, which reached 8-3/4 pct on February 18 has fallen to 7-3/4 pct this week, dealers noted.     The Bank of France's "open market" policy to regulate the money markets since December has been based on a floor and ceiling of rates within the limits of its intervention and seven day repurchase rates.     For the moment the sentiment is of "wait and see" on rate cuts, but there are now more optimists than pessimists among market operators, a dealer for a major French bank said.     Dealers said there is abundant liquidity on the bond market, noting that this week's monthly Treasury tap issue of 11.87 billion francs had a good reception and was fairly easily absorbed.     The Treasury had set an upper limit on the issue of 12 billion francs and was likely to continue to try and sell as much paper as it could over coming months to meet its borrowing needs for this year of around 150 billion, one banker said.     Dealers said there was no difficulty in placing liquidity in the primary market at the moment despite competition from the surge in investments on the Paris stock exchange.     There has been a flood of large bond issues, but with formulas well adapted to market conditions and investor demand - with warrants or a mix of fixed and floating-rates - which have been snapped up, and with generally broadly negative fees.     Dealers pointed to the recent Caisse d'Aide a l'Equipement des Collectivites Locales (CAECL) 8.90 pct two billion franc bond with warrants exchangeable for floating-rate bonds issued over 13 years and 80 days at 97.04 pct with payment date March 9, which was today quoted at -0.90 to -1.10 pct.     Even classic fixed-rate issues, after being neglected since the end of last year, are finding buyers, one banker said.     Dealers said that now the question was to see how the terms of imminent operations would be set, with great market interest focussed on the likely three next issues.     These will include an expected four to five billion franc issue for Electricite de France, to be followed by a bond of around one billion francs for Auxiliaire du Credit Foncier, a subsidiary of the banking group Credit Foncier de France, and a new issue by tender from the mortgage agency Caisse de Refinancement Hypothecaire.

interest,gnp	IMF URGES BELGIUM TO MAKE FURTHER SPENDING CUTS .  The Belgian government, which introduced large-scale public spending reductions last year, has been told by an International Monetary Fund team there is scope for further cuts in 1988.     The suggestion is contained in the preliminary conclusions of the annual IMF consultations with Belgium on its economic policy, a copy of which was distributed to journalists at the weekly press conference following meetings of the cabinet.     The IMF team also urges Belgium to adopt a firm interest rate policy, with a particular emphasis on long-term rates.     The team's report to the government praises last year's spending cuts, which are due to reduce 1987 government spending by 195 billion francs, and says 1986 saw the Belgian economy perform "better, on a broader basis, than at any time so far in the 1980s."     However, it adds that with lower inflation, stabilisation of the debt to gross national product ratio requires a much lower budget deficit than the seven pct of GNP target the government has set itself for 1989.     The government's net financing requirement was 11.0 pct of GNP in 1986.     The report says "The most that can be afforded over the next few years is a zero growth of real non-interest expenditure of general Government."     It says there is a need for a revision of the Belgian tax system to iron out distortions and meet hopes of a reduced tax burden but substantial progress is needed in stabilising the debt to GNP ratio before this is possible.     "Because of the difficulty of sustaining zero expenditure growth and of likely growing impatience (for) tax reductions, we feel that your position would be stronger if you could decide on rather sharp expenditure reductions in 1988," the report adds.     The IMF urges a strong interest rate policy to signal the government's determination to keep its currency strong and to curb inflation.     It says firmer long-term rates would slow private net long-term capital outflows, which increased strongly in 1986.     It also urges net repayments of foreign currency debt and an overhaul of domestic capital markets to facilitate the subscriptions by non-residents of government bond issues in Belgian francs.

Since then, the pound has risen to 71.8 pct on its closing trade-weighted index, up from 69.7 pct imediately after the Paris meeting and up 0.4 on the day.     Today's peak at 72.0 pct was its highest since August 19.     A Treasury spokesman said Lawson had said he neither wanted a substantial rise or fall in sterling. The question is therefore how large a rise he is ready to see before acting.     Paul Temperton, chief economist at Merrill Lynch Europe Ltd, estimated that the government wanted to see the trade-weighted index about 72-73 pct. "Even after this action over the last few weeks, sterling's only just within striking distance of that range," he said.     Other analysts agree that the government probably has some broad target range around this area.     However, they said Lawson would be prepared to see the pound go higher at least in the short term, despite the risk of a loss of export competitiveness and cheaper prices on imports.     "If the Bank of England keeps the interest rates as they are, what's to stop it (going higher)," said John Cox, executive director of EBC Amro Bank Ltd, a major operator on the London foreign exchange market.     Cox estimates that the Bank of England has been active selling sterling over the past few days, despite the lack of general market talk of such intervention, and this has helped keep it below 1.60 dlrs.     The pound rose to 1.5870 dlrs from 1.5764 yesterday and 1.5400 February 23, the day after the Paris meeting.     But Cox says the government must be worried with sterling heading toward 2.95 marks and would be very concerned if it holds around these levels.     He warned the Bank may run the risk of missing the interest rate boat. "If rates don't come down, the market will say they ought to have come down and will sell sterling," he said.     Most dealers agree there is a good deal of "hot money" being invested in sterling, money simply attracted by high overnight or one-week rates, which could flow out at equally short notice.     However, the authorities will hope that at least a proportion of the buying reflects long-term investment.     "The last thing they want to do is reduce them (rates) and have to jack them back up again," said Richard Jeffrey, economist at brokerage house Hoare Govett Ltd.     He said a half point cut would ensure continued support for sterling, at least in the near term.     However, most analysts are still looking for a full point about March 17, Budget Day.     The Bank must hold out until it sees the reaction to the Budget, said Temperton.     The Budget is widely forecast to be a vote winner in the run-up to a general election, the major factor behind current bullishness in the government bond and currency markets.     "Lawson wants to delay a cut in base rates until the budget. He wants it to be crowned with the glory of an interest rate cut," said Ian Harwood, economist at Warburg Securities, the equities arm of Mercury International Group.     Speculation a clearing bank might break ranks and lead the way lower were confounded today. There was excitement a fall in the weekly Treasury Bill rate to 9.7 pct from 10.2 pct last Friday might mean the Bank had changed its mind.     This followed the imposition of penal lending rates of 11 3/4 pct on the discount houses yesterday, and was the lowest since base rates were at 10 pct, early last October.     However, with this Bill rate pertaining to three-months money, banking sources said the market could not take the cut as a guide to the Bank's intentions on short term rates.  REUTER &#3;
grain,corn	LYNG DISAPPOINTED BY CANADA CORN INJURY DECISION .  U.S. Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng said he is "very disappointed" by a Canadian government finding that U.S. corn has injured Ontario Corn growers.     "This action is not helpful in the context of the ongoing U.S.-Canada free trade talks or in the new round of multilateral trade negotiations," Lyng said in a statement.     The Canadian government today said Ottawa would continue to apply a duty of 84.9 cents per bushel on U.S. corn imports.     Lyng said the U.S. made a case that U.S. corn imports are not the cause of any problem of Canadian corn producers, adding that U.S. corn exports to Canada are declining.     "Apparently they (Canada) have ignored the fact that Canadian corn and other coarse grain production is rising faster than consumption," Lyng said.  Reuter &#3;

The U.S. National Association of Wheat Growers (NAWG) urged the Reagan administration offer the Soviet Union wheat under the export enhancement program (eep).     In a letter to Agriculture Secretary Richard Lyng, NAWG stated its "strong support" for an eep offer to Moscow.     "We believe that a solid case continues to exist for Soviet EEP eligibility, and the recently announced and reported Soviet purchases of U.S. corn indicate a Soviet willingness to purchase U.S. grain if it is competitively priced," NAWG said.     "Consequently, we believe it is important to renew the U.S. eep offer and do all that is reasonably possible to ensure mutual adherence to the terms of the U.S.-Soviet grain agreement," the letter said.

earn	ABN SAYS PROFIT RISE ENCOURAGING IN VIEW DOLLAR .  Algemene Bank Nederland N.V. &lt;ABNN.AS> chairman Robertus Hazelhoff said the bank's 10.3 pct increase in net 1986 profit to 527 mln guilders from 478 mln in 1985 was encouraging in view of the sharply lower dollar.     Hazelhoff, speaking at a press conference after the release of ABN's 1986 results, said a sharp decrease in foreign earnings had been compensated by a strong domestic performance, notably in the securities business.     He said the bank was also proposing a one for 10 share-split which should facilitate trade in the bank's stock.     News of the split sparked a 14 guilder rise in ABN's share price on the Amsterdam bourse to a close of 517 guilders.     Prospects for 1987 hung on three uncertainties, namely the future trend of the dollar, the level of interest rates and ABN's share of equities trade, Hazelhoff said.     Provisions for general contingencies were reduced in 1986 by 4.1 pct to 575 mln guilders, while taxes increased by 2.1 pct to 242 mln guilders, he added.     Lower global interest rates in 1986 had nipped earnings margins via traditional lending activities, he said.     Hazelhoff said ABN was unlikely to continue reducing risk provisions in the future but he noted the bank was not overly concerned about default by Latin American debtors, a factor which brokers say has distanced Dutch insititutions from bank stocks recently.     He said that of the bank's estimated 25 financially troubled sovereign debtors, about one quarter were Latin American countries. These would ultimately pay up, he said.     He added that losses incurred through loans to tin producers in the wake of the tin council crisis at end-1985 had been written off.  REUTER &#3;

jobs	FRENCH GOVERNMENT TO STEP UP AID TO JOBLESS .  The government plans to go ahead with a three billion franc package to help the long-term unemployed, with the aim of guaranteeing social security payments to everyone becoming redundant, government officials said.     At present only about one-third of the country's 2.6 mln jobless, corresponding to 10.9 pct of the workforce, receive unemployment benefit.     Prime Minister Jacques Chirac told a television interviewer, "As soon as the law is approved, and it will be in a matter of weeks, all workers made redundant will have the right to social benefits."     The money, which will be used to alleviate unemployment through retraining or project finance, will come from a 7.5 billion franc government fund set up last month to finance spending on special areas of concern.     Apart from unemployment, these include relief to farmers hit by European Community cost-cutting measures.     French unemployment has risen by more than 40 pct from 1.8 mln when socialist President Francois Mitterrand took office in 1981.  REUTER &#3;

crude	CRUDE OIL PRICES UP AS STOCKS, OUTPUT FALL .  U.S. crude oil prices rose above 18  dlrs a barrel this week and industry analysts said the price could rise another dollar as inventories fall.     "OPEC is keeping its production down, and in the cash market there is tight supply of crude with short transportation time to major refining centers," said Daniel McKinley, oil analyst with Smith Barney, Harris Upham and Co. "That could send prices 50 cts to a dollar higher," he added.     The U.S. benchmark crude West Texas Intermediate rose to 18.15 dlrs a barrel today, a rise of 1.50 dlrs this week.     The rally in oil prices this week came after prices fell in February more than two dlrs from its high of 18.25 dlrs a barrel.     "Oil traders were pulling prices down on the assumption that oil stocks were building and OPEC was producing well above its 15.8 mln bpd quota, but now both of those assumptions have come under question," McKinley said.     Yesterday the International Energy Agency in its monthly report said that oil stocks in the OECD area, or in industrialized nations, were drawn down by 1.3 mln bpd during the first quarter of this year.     IEA estimates that the draw in oil stocks during the first quarter of this year will come largely from oil companies whose inventory levels by April one will be an estimated 326 mln tonnes, or about 74 days consumption.     Industry analysts also said the estimate of a 3.5 mln bpd draw in stocks made by Shell Chairman Peter Holmes yesterday fed speculation that other major companies were destocking.     Traders said the destocking has come about as a result of a so-called buyers strike, which kept refiners from buying officially priced OPEC oil in an effort to get the organization to offer discounts to the official price.     "This struggle between the companies and OPEC is the ultimate game of chicken but it will be resolved relatively soon. I would imagine by about the middle of the month (March)," the general trading manager of an international oil company told Reuters in a telephone interview.     For its part OPEC has moved to win this game by cutting excess supplies from the market by a reduction of its own output, traders said. A Reuter survey estimates OPEC output to be 14.7 mln bpd this week.     Also, an earthquake in Ecuador yesterday led it to suspend oil exports indefintiely and force majeure its shipments.     "This will reduce short-haul availabilities by about 250,000 bpd almost immediately and the longer the suspension continues, the larger the draw in stocks will be for companies expecting it to be there," McKinley said.     International oil traders said that other short-haul crudes, such as North Sea Brent, were also scarce because Asian refiners bought the oil after absorbing a lot of the readily available Mideast crudes earlier this week.     If this pattern continues then oil companies will bid up the price of oil as they purchase for their refineries, trading managers at several companies told Reuters.     But there were skeptics who said they wondered how long OPEC can retain its unity if buyer resistance continues.     Stephen Hanke, chief economist at Friedburg Commodity Management, said OPEC production was lower "because of the Saudi cut (to 3.1 mln bpd) and this could spell trouble if it gives other members an incentive to exceed their quotas."      He added, "The Saudis will be picking up the tab for other members who produce over their quota, and the drain on the Saudis will continue, forcing them to cut output maybe as low as 2.5 mln bpd to support the 18 dlrs average price," he added.     There are also signs of some OPEC crudes being sold in the spot market at below OPEC official prices, traders said.     Oil traders said Nigerian Brass River sold for delivery into the U.S. Gulf at a price related to North Sea brent, which traded this week at 17.60 dlrs, far below the official price of 18.92 dlrs for the similar quality Bonny Light.     Iranian oil is also surfacing in the U.S. Gulf and the Far East at reported discounts to its 17.50 dlrs official price.     "There is a lot of oil priced on government-to-government deals, which are below official prices and this is probably being resold," one international trader said.  Reuter &#3;
sugar,corn,grain	MGE PLANNING APRIL 6 START UP OF HFCS CONTRACT .  The Minneapolis Grain Exchange (MGE) will start trading futures contracts in high fructose corn syrup on April 6 if the Commodity Futures Trading Commission (CFTC) approves the contract as expected next week.     Pat Henderson, spokesperson for the MGE, said the exchange expects contract approval at CFTC's Tuesday meeting. It has been under review since the exchange submitted the proposal in December, 1985.     The proposed contract is based on 48,000 pound lots of 55-pct high fructose corn syrup, the equivalent of one tank truck of the sweetening agent derived from corn in the wet milling process. The syrup, commonly called HFCS-55, is most commonly used as a sweetener in soft drinks and other beverages.     Delivery would be by shipping certificate from production facilities designated by the exchange. The contract, designated by the symbol "HF," would trade from 0900 to 1315 CST. Months traded would correspond with the Chicago corn futures months of March, May, July, September and December.     Contract price will be quoted per hundred weight, with a minimum price fluctuation of one cent and maximum fluctuation of one dlr per CWT.     "We hope the producers and users of fructose will be actively involved, those producers being the large processors, the corn wet millers, and the users being the beverage bottlers," Henderson said. "But there are potentials for all types of people to use it. There is quite a list of industries that utilize fructose."  Reuter &#3;

Telecom Plus International Inc said &lt;Siemens AG>'s Siemens Information Systems wants to amend its agreement to purchase Telecom's 65 pct interest in Tel Plus Communications to delay payment of 25 mln dlrs for 11 months.     Telecom's shareholders are scheduled to vote on the 165 mln dlr transaction Monday.     Telecom said it advised Siemens it intends to close the transaction on March 16, as scheduled, if it is approved by shareholders. A spokesman said this means Telecom will decide before the 16th whether or not to accept the proposed change.     Explaining its request for the amendment, Siemens informed Telecom it had recently become aware of information causing concern with respect to certain accounting and other matters.     Siemens said it will therefore need to continue its review beyond March 16 to determine whether certain representations and warranties are true.     Telecom said it advised Siemens it knows of no information which would make its representations and warranties untrue.     Siemens already owns the remaining 35 pct of Tel Plus. The 65 pct represenmts Telecom's principal operating asset.     A Telecom spokesman said the agreement calls for payment of all but 29 mln dlrs of the price at closing. Of this, 21 mln dlrs was to be paid 11 months later and two mln dlrs per year on the anniversary date of the transaction.     He said Siemens is now proposing that 25 mln dlrs be added to the 21 mln dlrs to be paid in 11 months.     Telecom said the proposed amendment would also permit Siemens to defer repayment of up to an additional 50 pct of certain intercompany debt until completion of the review. Telecom said it estimates this to ba about 15 mln dlrs.  Reuter &#3;
gold	PIONEER GROUP UNIT GETS MORE GHANA GOLD LAND .  The Pioneer Group Inc said its 70 pct-owned Teberebie Goldfields Ltd venture was granted an additional concession of land in Ghana to seek and mine gold.     The State Gold Mining Corp of Ghana granted the venture an additional 14.5 square kilometers in Teberebie, Ghana, contiguous to 11.5 square kilometers granted earlier.     The original concession appears to have a substantial amount of gold bearing material containing about 2 grams, or 6/100 ounces, of gold per tonne. But the venture has no firm estimate on the costs of extracting the gold and no assurances can be given that the reserves can be mined profitably, the company said. It said Teberebie Goldfields has not conducted tests on the newly granted land but added the land seems to be similar in geological characteristics to the original land.  Reuter &#3;

acq	LUCKY STORES &lt;LKS>, EDELMAN IN STANDSTILL PACT .  Lucky Stores Inc said it and investor Asher Edelman agreed on a settlement that prohibits Edelman and his group from taking specified actions to obtain control of the company and that limits the Edelman group's ownership of Lucky's stock to less than five pct of any voting securities.     The arrangement also provides for the dismissal of pending litigation between the parties, Lucky Stores said.     The settlement also calls for the withdrawal of Edelman's motion to intervene in pending shareholder actions against Lucky Stores and its directors, the company said.     In addition, the standstill provisions also apply to Hancock Fabrics after it is spun off to Lucky stockholders, the company said.     Lucky Stores said the arrangement also calls for the company to submit to stockholders at a special meeting set for December 31 a proposal from Edelman seeking their views concerning repeal of a charter provision that limits the voting power of substantial Lucky stockholders.     Edelman, who owns about five pct of Lucky Stores' stock, last year was rebuffed in his effort to acquire the company.     Last October Lucky Stores implimented a restructuring program that included the repurchase of 28 pct of its own common shares and reincorporation in Delaware.     The spinoff of Hancock Textile Co, a chain of 324 retail stores, was one of the key parts of the restructuring program.     Edelman and his Plaza Securities Co partnership subsequently sued in an attempt to block the proposed reincorporation, which was a condition of the repurchase and restructuring plan.     Under this latest arrangement, Lucky Stores said it agreed to reimburse the Edelman group for 2.8 mln dlrs of out-of-pocket expenses, which include litigation and other costs.     "This agreement serves the interests of Lucky stockholders by avoiding the significant cost of continued litigation and the accompanying demands on management time," Lucky Stores chairman John Lillie said in a statement.

earn	ATT &lt;T> PHONE PROPOSAL TO HELP PROFITS .  American Telephone and Telegraph Co's proposal to deregulate its long distance phone service is unlikely to produce a radical change in phone rates, but it should help the company's profits, analysts said.     "Deregulation will mean more pricing discounts for large volume users, but status quo for residential users," said PaineWebber Group analyst Jack Grubman.     But the proposals will scrap the pricing formula that has constrained the company's profits in the long distance business, leading to higher profit margins, analysts said.     ATT has long pushed for deregulation of its long-distance business, the profits of which have been limited by a regulated rate-of-return on the company's investments. The rate was cut last year to 12.20 from 12.75 pct.     Earlier today the company proposed to the Federal Communications Commission to scrap the formula, cut the amount of time needed to approve rate proposals, and leave it up to its competitors to oppose it filings.     MCI Communications Corp &lt;MCIC> made a similar filing yesterday, saying greater the moves would increase competition in the telephone business.     Analysts said the proposals will allow ATT to cut costs in the long-distance unit, and increase its profit margins previously constrained by the rate of return. But many said they did not expect the proposals to lead to higher prices in the industry, simply because of the competition the phone industry giant faces.     "You probably wouldn't see as much of a price decline," said Gartner Group analyst Fritz Ringling. "But you wouldn't see a rise." Grubman said the proposals will allow ATT to selectively raise or lower prices, depending on the market. "It will give ATT a lot more flexibility," he said.     ATT now faces a period of comment in which a number of companies will be able to respond to the proposals in FCC hearings.     It may face at least one strong opponent, U.S. Sprint, the long distance joint venture between GTE Corp &lt;GTE> and United Telecommunications Inc &lt;UT>.     "We think the Congress of the FCC should establish a reasonable rate of return. Someone should establish it," a U.S. Sprint spokesman said. But he added the company was not opposed to greater competition.     It may also take some time for the proposals to go through, and in the process they may be altered by the various constituencies affected by the move.     "There's so much complexity, so much inertia, so much bureacracy, that stricly speaking about the mechanisms, it won't happen that fast," said analyst Victor Krueger of the Gartner Group.

The company added, however, that about 13.6 mln dlrs of the loss relates to discontinued operations and disposal of subsidiaries.     The company said the loss is part of its previously announced restructuring that includes the sale of its foreign and domestic units.

TWA has offered 52 dlrs per share for USAir Group. USAir rejected the offer yesterday, calling it a last-minute attempt to interfere with its takeover of Piedmont Aviation Inc.     A TWA spokesman said the company has filed an application for approval on its offer to buy USAir with the Department of Transportation, and later today it will file a response to USAir's motion with the DOT to dismiss the TWA application.     TWA said it made the statement today on its stock position in USAir in response to inquiries.     Traders said they believed TWA Chairman Carl Icahn was the buyer of an 855,000 share block crossed today by Salomon Brothers.     USAir stock was trading at 50-3/4, up 2-1/4 on heavy volume of 3.1 mln shares. TWA stock fell 3/8 to 30-5/8.     While analysts and arbitragers have speculated that Icahn may have made the offer for USAir in order to trigger the acquisition of his own airline, Wall Street today began to take Icahn's effort more seriously.     "I think he's going to be the next Frank Lorenzo of Wall Street," said one market source. Lorenzo, chairman of Texas Air, has added to his airline with the acquisitions of Eastern Airlines and People Express Airlines.

acq	GROUP TO BOOST FAIRCHILD INDUSTRIES (FEN) STAKE .  An investor group led by New York investor George Soros said it was dissatisfied with Fairchild Industries Inc management and was considering boosting its holdings to as much as 49.9 pct of the aerospace and aviation company's outstanding stock.     The group already controls 1,647,481 Fairchild Industries shares or 11.5 pct of the total outstanding.     The group said it filed on Wednesday with federal antitrust regulators for advance clearance to buy enough additional shares to increase its total stake to up to 49.9 pct of the total outstanding stock.     The group said its representatives had met with Fairchild Industries officials to inform them "that they do not believe management has been successful in enhancing or protecting shareholder values."     It said it was considering the additional share purchases to enable it to "assert a greater degree of influence over the future management and policies of the issuer."     It said a decision on the specific level of share ownership it would seek depended on market prices, future changes in management policies, available financial resources and other factors.     The group said it also reserved the right to pursue other measures intended to influence Fairchild management and policies, either alone or in concert with other investors.     The group includes Soros and Quantum Fund, an offshore investment firm headquartered in Curacao, Netherlands Antilles that is advised by Soros.     The group said that since its last SEC filing, made Jan. 2, it had purchased no additional Fairchild shares and had sold 6,700 shares on the New York Stock Exchange Jan. 19.     A Fairchild Industries official later said Soros had told the company he was not dissatisfied with its management.     "Contrary to the filing, Mr. Soros has told the company today that he is not dissatisfied with management," Fairchild's Bill Fulwider told Reuters.     However, Fulwider said the company would have nothing to say at this time about Soros' disclosure that he may buy up enough additional Fairchild shares to hold as much as 49.9 pct of the company's outstanding stock.

"It was not a wonderful sales quarter, but it only represents 14 pct of the year's total results," Stanley said.     Stanley also said that 1987 full year sales will be in excess of 1.8 billion dlrs as compared to the 1.5 billion dlrs reported in 1986. He also said that analysts' estimates of 1.55 dlr per shr for 1987 "are not crazy."     Payless reported net income of 1.22 dlr per share in 1986.     "The economy may not get a lot better, but we expect our advantages in the lumber industry and cost cutting measures to keep us competitive," Larry Kunz, chief financial officer, said.      The company acquired Knox Lumber Co for about 24.3 mln dlrs in October 1986.     Stanley said the company's stronger-than-optimal balance sheet will enable it to make further acquisitions but no negotiations are going on at the current time.

ship,gas	BRAZIL STRIKES CAUSE GOVERNMENT MAJOR PROBLEMS .  Strikes by Brazil's 40,000 seamen and by petrol station owners in four states are causing major headaches to a government already wrestling with a debt crisis.     A week ago seamen began their first national strike for 25 years and union leaders say they have seriously affected Brazilian exports by making idle 160 ships.     On February 20 the Brazilian government suspended interest payments on part of its huge foreign debt following a sharp deterioration in its trade balance.     Today the government faced a fresh problem, when most petrol station owners in Sao Paulo, the country's industrial heartland, and in three other states closed down to press for higher fuel prices.     There were fears that the combination of the two stoppages could lead to a serious fuel shortage.     The seamen's leaders say their strike has halted 48 of the 72 ships belonging to the state oil company Petrobras.     The Jornal do Brasil newspaper, in an editorial today entitled "Dangerous Confrontation," said: "From the economic point of view the seamen's strike carries an alarming cost, with grave consequences for the supply situation and for the country's external trade."     The seamen are seeking a 275 pct pay rise and have rejected offers of up to 100 pct.     Later today the Higher Labour Tribunal in Brasilia is due to rule on whether the seamen's strike is legal. But a senior official of the National Merchant Marine Union, Jorge Luis Leao Franco, told Reuters that the strike would continue regardless of the tribunal's ruling.     Labour unrest has worsened in Brazil following the collapse over the last few months of the government's Cruzado Plan price freeze. Prices have been rising at about 15 pct a month. Not only workers but also businessmen are restive. Petrol station owners said many garages had closed indefinitely today in Sao Paulo, Parana, Mato Grosso and Mato Grosso do Sul.     Television reports said that in the Parana state capital of Curitiba petrol stations were only supplying fuel for exceptional cases such as ambulances and funeral processions.     Brazilian garage owners want to be allowed to raise their profits on alcohol fuel and petrol sales to 1.26 cruzados (six U.S. Cents) a litre from 0.56 cruzados (about 2.5 cents).     Queues formed at petrol stations in Sao Paulo late last night as motorists filled up their tanks while they still could.     Political sources said the government of President Jose Sarney was closely following the strikes and the overall fuel supply situation.  Reuter &#3;
acq	DOME PETE&lt;DMP> SAID TO BE PRESSED TO SELL ENCOR .  Dome Petroleum Ltd is under pressure from one of its largest creditors, &lt;Canadian Imperial Bank of Commerce>, to sell its 42 pct stake in &lt;Encor Energy Corp Ltd>, energy industry analysts said.     Dome has pledged its 42.5 mln Encor shares as security for part of its debt to Commerce Bank, estimated last year at 947 mln Canadian dlrs, and the bank wants Dome to sell the stock to pay down debt, analysts said.     "The Commerce has been slowly but surely moving Encor in the direction that might make it a saleable asset," said one analyst who asked not to be named.     Dome earlier said it was not considering selling Encor Energy, but reaffirmed the company's 23.3 pct interest in Canadian gold producer Dome Mines Ltd &lt;DM> is up for sale "at the right price."     Dome, now negotiating a plan to restructure more than 6.10 billion dlrs in debt, sees Encor as a strategic investment that it does not intend to sell, spokesman David Annesley said. The Encor shares do not pay dividends.     A Commerce Bank spokesman also declined comment when asked whether it is pressing Dome to sell its Encor stake.     At current market prices, Dome's stake in Encor would be valued at about 308 mln dlrs, while its 20.9 mln Dome Mines shares would be worth about 319 mln dlrs.     Recent strength in the price of Encor shares may also prompt Commerce Bank to press Dome to divest its holding in the Canadian oil and gas producer, analysts said.     "Encor's stock price has improved quite substantially in recent weeks with a runup in crude prices," Peters and Co Ltd oil analyst Wilf Gobert commented.     "The possibility is that Commerce Bank would like to see it sold at these levels because they can get more for it now than they have been able to in recent years," he added.     Encor traded earlier on the Toronto Stock Exchange at 7-1/8, near its 52-week high of 7-1/2 and up from around six dlrs in early February.     The company also recently set up its own operating management, which was previously carried out by Dome Petroleum, Maison Placements Canada Inc analyst Denis Mote commented.     Dome and Encor "are actually going to get farther apart. So (the sale) does make a lot of sense," Mote said.     However, analysts said Dome will resist any moves to divest Encor in favor of retaining the operating assets since sale proceeds would likely go directly to pay down Dome's debt to Commerce Bank.     "I think they'll probably try to hang onto Encor as long as they can," said Bache Securities Inc analyst Doug Weber.     Some of Dome's group of 56 major creditors might move to block such a sale, arguing they have a claim on company assets.     "Other creditors generally all want to make sure that something they might be able to get a piece of is not being sold out from under them," said analyst Gobert.     Another stumbling block would be Encor's 225 mln dlr joint liability in loans to Dome Petroleum advanced by Arctic Petroleum Corp of Japan for Beaufort Sea exploration.     Analysts said a similar hurdle could also hinder the possible sale of Dome Petroleum's interest in Dome Mines.     Dome Mines has guaranteed 225 mln dlrs of Dome Petroleum's debt and has a "right of consent" to the sale of Dome Petroleum's holding.     Presumably, a potential buyer of the Dome Mines shares would seek some type of relief on the company's debt obligations connected with Dome Petroleum, Gobert said.     Dome spokesman Annesley earlier declined to specify at what price the company would consider selling its Dome Mines shares, but said current prices of more than 15 dlrs a share "are very attractive."

"At a time when the world is attempting to liberalize trade in the new rounnd of multilateral negotiations, it is incomprehensible that a country that stands to gain so much from the reduction in agricultural trade barriers would threaten that process by caving in to pressures for protectionism," council president Darwin E.

grain,wheat	U.S. FEEDGRAIN 0/92 SUPPORTERS EVALUATE POSITION .  Advocates of a 0/92 plan for feedgrains will likely delay offering their proposals if a disaster aid bill before the House Agriculture Committee is scaled back to include only 1987 winter wheat, congressional sources said.     The disaster aid bill, introduced by Rep. Glenn English (D-Okla.), sparked sharp controversy with its proposals to implement a 0/92 program for 1987 wheat and 1988 winter wheat.     An agreement has been reached to trim the bill back to 1987 wheat, but supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains plan said even that scaled-down version would not be equitable for farmers.     Unless the English bill pertains only to 1987 winter wheat, it is more than a simple disaster payment and feedgrains should be treated equally, they said.    If the bill is narrowed to just winter wheat, then supporters of a 0/92 feedgrains amendment will probably not offer their proposals next week, sources said.    English has agreed to support an amendment by Rep. Charles Stenholm (R-Tex) to narrow the bill to 1987 wheat only, but whether he would also back a further reduction is unclear.     Agricultural aides to English said the congressman's first choice is to make the option available to all 1987 wheat farmers. However, if the political reality is that disaster aid for winter wheat farmers would be unavailable because of controversy over spring wheat, then English might consider an even greater cutback in the bill, they said.     Under a 0/92 plan, farmers could forego planting and still receive 92 pct of deficiency payments.     Rep. Arlan Stangeland (R-Minn.) and Harold Volkmer (D-Mo.) have both expressed interest in expanding the English bill to include a 0/92 program for feedgrains.     An aide said Stangeland does not want to reopen the farm bill, but to be fair to all crops.     Only a small percentage of spring wheat farmers would likely sign up for 0/92 since the incentives to plant are greater than to idle the land, economists said.     Opponents to a 0/92 feedgrains program argue it is premature to make major changes in the farm bill and that the House Agriculture Committee needs to study more closely the impacts of such a program.

Canada's ruling in favor of a duty on U.S. corn was a keen disappointment to the National Corn Growers Association and has set a dangerous precedent for other nations to follow, said Mike Hall, lobbyist for the association.     "The French corn growers will clearly charge ahead now and just change corn to corn gluten feed" in their complaint, Hall told Reuters.     A Canadian government agency ruled today that U.S. farm policies are causing injury to Canadian corn farrmers and supported an earlier imposed countervailing duty of about 85 cts per bushel.     "This was cleary a political decision," Hall said. "The amount of corn we export to Canada is insignificant."     The unexpected ruling appeared to be based on the agrument that Canada bases its corn prices on U.S. futures prices and that American farm policy has driven down these prices, thus causing lower prices to Canadian farmers and larger government payments through its farm stabilization program, Hall said.     Hall said this is a new definition for injury, but that other nations might also now apply this same argument to attack U.S. farm programs.     The French corn growers could now charge that U.S. farm programs create an unfair subsidy for corn gluten feed, Hall said. The French have long wanted to control the imports of U.S. corn gluten feed into the community, saying that the imported feed was unfairly displacing European grain.  Reuter &#3;

The 49-page report contains an in-depth examination of the problems of gas developoment and looks at different ways in which contractual terms might deal with the risks in gas development associated with pricing, marketing and volume.

acq	TAFT&lt;TFB> BIDDERS WOULD SELL ENTERTAINMENT UNIT .  A proposed buyout of Taft Broadcasting Co by Dudley Taft and other investors includes a plan to sell the company's Entertainment Group, according to one of the investors.     Jonathan Nelson, managing director of Narragansett Capital Corp &lt;NARR>, which is participating in the buyout plan, declined to say if buyers have already been lined up for the Entertainment Group. "We are considering selling the group," Nelson said. Wall Street analysts said any of the Hollywood film studios which might be interested.     Taft Broadcasting Co did not comment on the 145 dlr per share offer. Taft has 9.2 mln shares outstanding, of which 12 pct are owned by the Taft and Ingalls families.     Dudley Taft relinquished the title of president in July but continues as vice chairman of the company.     Taft-Narragansett requsted a response to its proposal by March 12.     If the plan is accepted, Taft would be a private company financed by high yield bonds and bank debt, Nelson said. Narragansett is an investment management company specializing in leveraged buyout transactions.     Taft shares climbed 19 to 151-1/2, causing arbitrageurs to say investors believe the bidders may raise their price.     Robert M. Bass, who controls 25 pct of the stock, and American Financial Corp, holder of 15 pct, did not return telephohe calls seeking comment.     But Dennis McAlpine, analyst at Oppenheimer and Co, said "I don't think it's worth 150 dlrs." He noted Taft recently agreed to sell a group of independent television stations at a loss. He said the entertainment group, which includes the Hanna-Barbara animation studios, is currently hampered by a glut of animated product.     Taft Broadcasting has never commented on reports that its major stockholders met recently to discuss a break-up of the company.     MacAlpine said there are lots of options for reshaping the company with a distribution of various pieces to the major shareholders among the possibilities.     Analyst Alan Gottesman of L.F. Rothschild, Unterberg Towbin Inc said the Bass group has been increasing its stake in the belief the company would be worth more with a change in its strategy. He said Bass pushed for sale of the independent television stations because the company paid too much.  Reuter &#3;
interest,crude	POSITIVE OUTLOOK TEMPERED IN U.S. DEBT FUTURES .  Higher oil prices and stronger than expected U.S. employment growth led to sharp losses in U.S. interest rate futures and diminished what had been a positive chart outlook, financial analysts said.     The increase of 319,000 in non-farm payroll employment during February was above market expectations for a rise of 170,000 to 200,000 jobs and sparked selling in Treasury bond futures that drove the June contract through key technical support at 101-2/32 at the opening Friday, they noted.     "I don't like that fact that we had a close below 101," said Prudential Bache analyst Fred Leiner. The 101-2/32 level in the June bond contract had been the top of a three-month trading range, which when penetrated during the rally Wednesday led to bullish forecasts by chartists.     But analysts called it a false breakout on the weekly charts when the June bond closed at 100-10/32 Friday.     Some also forecast that the high of the week at 101-19/32 may signal a bearish double top formation portending steep losses.     "I tend to go along with the double top scenario," said Northern Futures analyst Eileen Rico.     Rico noted that the possible formation, along with the fact that the rally of the last two weeks in bond futures has occurred on relatively low volume, were negative signals.     Despite what could be a negative chart outlook, Leiner remains cautiously optimistic, and June bonds should find support between 100 and 99-16/32 next week.     The optimistic outlook, as well as Leiner's expectation that the yield curve will flatten in the near term, is based on an improving inflation outlook.     With the dollar stable and economic data giving the Federal Reserve little room to ease monetary policy, "the inflation outlook is improving," Leiner said, and that should lead to relatively stronger bond prices than bill and Eurodollar prices.     Still, Leiner noted that the recent rise in oil prices remains a concern for the inflation outlook.     Oil rose during the week on reports that OPEC nations were maintaining production quotas and official prices, and got an extra boost Friday due to the suspension of oil exports from Ecuador after an earthquake Thursday.     "The runup in crude oil will be a short-lived phenomenon," said Carroll McEntee and McGinley analyst Brian Singer.     The rise in oil prices over the past week has been largely "media induced," Singer said. He noted that even though OPEC production may be within quotas, "oil stocks are at tremendously high levels."     Although the Ecuador situation could cause a delay, oil prices will eventually decline to the lows of late February, he said, and that will be a supportive influence for bond prices.  Reuter &#3;

strategic-metal	U.S. TREASURY PROPOSES SOME S. AFRICAN IMPORTS .  The Treasury proposed allowing  temporary imports of South African uranium ore and uranium oxide until July 1 under certain conditions pending clarification of anti-apartheid laws passed by Congress last fall.     The proposal to be published in the Federal Register next week requests written congressional and public comment within 60 days and deals with uranium ore and oxide that is imported for U.S. processing and exporting to third countries.     The Treasury said it proposed allowing the temporary imports because it felt Congress had not intended when it passed the comprehensive South African sanctions bill last fall -- overriding President Reagan's veto -- to hurt U.S. industry.     "The domestic uranium conversion industry and the federal government's enrichment industry could be seriously injured in a manner not intended by Congress if the . . . import ban on uranium ore and oxide were implemented to bar imports for processing and export through a mistaken interpretation of the act," the Treasury brief said.     The Treasury said an outright U.S. ban of uranium ore and oxide might cause foreign electric utilities to divert their South African origin ore and oxide to other countries including the Soviet Union for processing.     Treasury said it would allow imports of the South African ore and oxide until July 1 for processing and re-export "provided that the imported ore or oxide is accompanies by a license for importation issued by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission."     The Treasury brief also proposed allowing U.S.-origin goods to be imported temporarily from South African state-controlled organizations for repair or servicing in the United States.     "The U.S. Customs will allow such importation to be made under bond," the brief said.     The South African sanctions law, enacted by the United States to protest the apartheid laws of racial segregation practiced by South Africa's white minority government, prohibited imports of uranium ore and oxide, iron and steel, coal and textiles at the end of 1986.

The DOT added, however, that TWA was free to refile when it could put together an application for control that met the agency's procedural requirements.     The DOT acted shortly after the U.S. Department of Justice disclosed that it supported dismissal of the TWA application.     It was not immediately clear what impact the denial would have on TWA's bid to take over USAir.     In its control application, TWA had acknowledged that additional documentation was required to meet DOT rules and said it would file more material on the morning of March 9.     But the DOT said it would not wait.     "We have determined to dismiss TWA's application for approval of the acquisition of USAir," it said in an order issued late Friday.     "TWA's application clearly fails to comply with the filing requirements of our regulations...and TWA has provided no reason why we should accept such a deficient filing," it added.     "Accordingly, we will dismiss the application. TWA, of course, may refile it when it is able to comply with our procedural rules," the DOT said.     The agency added that it would continue to consider a separate TWA request for federal clearance to purchase USAir stock through a voting trust.

UAB called for a rights issue last November to raise 152.49 mln ringgit to rectify its capital deficiency following an accumulated loss of 107.61 mln ringgit at end-1985, the central bank, Bank Negara, said in a statement.     But only 16.99 mln ringgit in shares was taken up by shareholders, mainly local Indian and Malay businessmen and the Indian Government.     Bank Negara said it subsequently took up the unsubscribed shares, totalling 135.5 mln of UAB's new paid-up capital of 228.74 mln ringgit.     It said the shares, held in trust, will be eventually sold.     The central bank early this week also announced that it had bought 49.4 pct stake in another troubled commercial bank, &lt;Perwira Habib Bank Malaysia Bhd>, after the latter raised its capital to 405 mln ringgit from 105 in mid-January this year.     Bank Negara said it does not intend to hold on to the shares of the two banks.     "The injection of capital in PHB and in UAB including the recamp of management in these banks are some of the measures taken by the bank to strengthen public confidence in the stability of the these banks," it added.

Energy and Mines Minister Javier Espinosa announced on television the country would cut domestic fuel sales by 30 pct. A ministry statement had earlier announced indefinite suspension of crude oil exports, declaring force majeure.     Deputy Energy Minister Fernando Santos Alvite told a television interviewer that it could possibly take more than a month to repair Ecuador's main pipeline linking Amazon basin oil fields to the Pacific Ocean coast.     The quake on Thursday, which registered six on the 12-point Mercalli scale, killed at least six people and was centred near the Reventador volcano about 90 km (50 miles) east of Quito.     Ecuador had recently been pumping 260,000 barrels per day.

Fading hope for passengers trapped aboard a partially-sunk Channel ferry raised fears the accident could rank among this centuries' worst peacetime shipping tragedies.     Belgian Transport Minister Herman de Croo said there was no hope of rescuing any of about 220 passengers trapped in the Herald of Free Enterprise after it capsized off the Belgian coast last night.     If confirmed, the toll would make the incident the world's worst since a Soviet liner, the Admiral Nakhimov, collided with a freighter in the Black Sea last September and sank with the loss of nearly 400 lives. A further 856 people were rescued.     The world's deadliest single peacetime incident at sea was the sinking in 1912 of the Titanic with a loss of 1,500 lives.     The second biggest loss of life in peacetime was in 1914 when 1,014 people drowned when the liner Empress of Ireland collided with a freighter on the St Lawrence river in Canada.     The world's worst maritime disaster was in wartime that took 7,700 lives when the German liner Wilhelm Gustloff was torpedoed by a Soviet submarine in January 30, 1945.     In 1985, more than 200 were feared dead after two ferries sank near Dhaka, 174 drowned when a ferry capsized in China and 147 died when a launch sank off the Malaysian state of Sabah.  REUTER &#3;

gnp	GERMAN 1988 TAX CUTS RAISED BY 5.2 BILLION MARKS .  Senior officials in the West German coalition government said tax cuts planned for next year would be increased by 5.2 billion marks, in line with a pledge made by Finance Minister Gerhard Stoltenberg at last month's international monetary conference in Paris.     Gerold Tandler, General Secretary of the Christian Social Union Party, detailing the cuts at a news conference also attended by officials from the Christian Democratic Union and Free Democratic Party, said all of the additional 5.2 billion mark reduction would represent net tax relief.     An increase in revenue from other sources was not planned.     The reductions will be added on to a package of tax cuts already planned for 1988 amounting to some nine billion marks.     Tandler said three billion marks of the extra tax relief would be accounted for by reducing the rate of marginal increase in income tax.     An increase in personal tax allowances would save taxpayers 1.4 billion marks. Extra tax allowances for people whose children are being educated would cut 300 mln marks from the tax bill. A further 500 mln marks would be accounted for by increasing the level of special depreciations for small- and medium-sized companies.     The extra fiscal measures planned for next year are part of a general reform of the tax system which will come into effect in 1990. Stoltenberg had said in Paris that part of this reform, which will cut taxes by a gross 44 billion marks, would be introduced next year, ahead of schedule.     The West German government had come under pressure from the United States to stimulate its economy with tax cuts. But Stoltenberg said in a speech last night in Hamburg that, while the economy would continue to expand this year, the rate of growth was uncertain.     The government said in January it was aiming for real growth in Gross National Product this year of 2.5 pct, but some economists have revised their predictions down to two or below.     Stoltenberg said: "We remain on a course of expansion. Whether (this will be) under two pct, as some people believe, or around 2.5 pct as some others expect, or even closer to three pct, as the Kiel World Economic Institute forecast a few days ago, remains open at the moment."

ship	EXPERTS HAD EXPRESSED FEARS OVER RO-RO SAFETY .  As a British government investigation got under way into the sinking of the car ferry Herald of Free Enterprise with heavy loss of life, experts said doubts had already been expressed about the roll-on roll-off type of ship.     Shipping minister Lord Brabazon said a preliminary investigation had started into why the 7,951 tonne ferry capsized and sank in little over a minute as it manoeuvred to leave Zeebrugge on a routine four hour crossing to Dover.     Initial reports spoke of water flooding the car decks through the bow doors. But a spokesman for the owners, Townsend Thoresen, said it was also possible the ferry had been holed.     Townsend Thoresen operate two other ships identical to the Herald of Free Enterprise, but Brabazon said it was not planned to pull them out of service at present.     "Our investigator is there already. We shall have to wait and see. But it is too early to say what happened," he told BBC radio.     As the work of retrieving bodies from the half-submerged hulk continued, maritime safety experts in London said doubts had already been expressed about the design of so-called "RoRo" ferries such as the Herald of Free Enterprise.     In 1980 the Inter-Governmental International Maritime Consultative Committee issued a report saying more roll-on roll-off vessels were lost in accidents than ships with deck areas divided by bulkheads.     Townsend Thoresen say the ship, built at the West German yard of Bremerhaven in 1980, was built to the highest safety standards.     But salvage expert William Cooper said passengers would have had problems getting off this type of ship because of its design.     Former Townsend Thoresen navigating officer Clive Langley said the RoRo type of vessels were similar in some respects to a barge.     "As any sailor knows it only takes two or three inches out of line and you can turn a barge over. An ordinary ship is compartmentalised and you have more stability," he said.     Cooper said cross-Channel ferries were normally perfectly stable but had huge wide deck areas above the water level.     "If you do get water into that area then you can get very severe effects on the stability of the ship," he added.  REUTER &#3;

Shipowners have offered a 100 per cent raise, which the seamen rejected.     "We have nothing to lose. If they want to lay off the workers, fine, but we are determined to carry on with our protest until the end," a union leader said.     He said they had decided in a meeting that if the marines take over the ships, the seamen would abandon the vessels and let the marines handle the situation by themselves.     A spokesman for the Rio de Janeiro Port said the order to send marines to take over the ports was given by Navy Minister Henrique Saboya on grounds that ports are areas of national security. But he said there were no incidents. The strike has cut exports and imports and made an estimated 160 ships idle.     Petrol station owners in four states also continued their shutdown and there were fears that the combination of the two stoppages could lead to a serious fuel shortage.  REUTER &#3;
crude	ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR FOUR MONTHS, OFFICIAL .  The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said.     The official said Ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast. It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline, the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters. Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks.     The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues.     Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of 173,500 bpd, according to the central bank.     However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline, costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take about 60 days to build.     Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986, had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of January, about equal to one month's imports.     It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in Latin America.     In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline.     Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in repayment in May, Lusinchi said.     A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and co-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.

tapioca,meal-feed	EC FARM LIBERALISATION SEEN HURTING THAI TAPIOCA .  Any European Community decision to liberalise farm trade policy would hurt Thailand's tapioca industry, said Ammar Siamwalla, an agro-economist at the Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI).     He told a weekend trade seminar here that any EC move to cut tariff protection for EC grains would make many crops more competitive than tapioca in the European market.     The EC is the largest buyer of Thai tapioca, absorbing more than two thirds of the 5.8 mln tonnes of pellets exported by Thailand last year. Thailand has an EC quota of an average 5.25 mln tonnes a year until 1990.     Ammar said Thailand had benefited from an EC tariff loophole that subjects Thai tapioca to a preferential six pct import duty.     Ammar, head of the agricultural research group of the TDRI, suggested tapioca farmers diversify to other crops.     He said: "If cereal prices in Europe fall so that they are close to world prices, the tapioca market there will disappear completely."     He said the issue may put Thailand in a dilemma because it had recently joined other major commodity producers in calling on the EC to cut its farm product export subsidies.  REUTER &#3;
cotton,sugar,veg-oil,grain	CHINA RAISES CROP PRICES TO INCREASE OUTPUT .  China has raised the prices it pays farmers for cotton, edible oil, sugar cane and beets to reverse a decline in output in 1986, He Kang, Minister of Agriculture, Animal Husbandry and Fisheries said.     The China Daily quoted He as saying China should adopt intensive farming to increase per hectare output and improve crop quality and maintain arable land at 111 mln hectares. He gave no details of the price increases.     On grain, He said the state will cut the quota it purchases from farmers by 50 mln tonnes and abolish the practice of purchasing through agents.     He said the state will increase investment in agriculture and supplies of fertiliser, diesel oil and other production materials and stabilise fertiliser and diesel oil prices.     The state offers cheap fertiliser and diesel oil and payment in advance to farmers who contract to supply grain at a low state-fixed price.     He said China aims to produce between 425 and 450 mln tonnes of grain by 1990, up from a target of 405 mln this year and an actual 391 mln last year.     He gave no more details.  REUTER &#3;

interest	GERMAN GOVERNMENT NEEDS SEEN RAISING BOND YIELDS .  Increased federal government borrowing needs and a growing unwillingness by foreign investors to buy mark assets could push yields in German public authority bonds higher this year, bond market sources say.     "At the moment we have a sideways movement in the short-term rates. But how rates move in the long end will depend strongly on foreigners," one portfolio manager for a large securities investment house in Frankfurt said.     The sources also said the government had already stepped up its borrowing programme in anticipation on increased needs.     Friday's loan stock was the third this year already, the sources noted. It carried a 10-year maturity, a coupon of six pct and price of 100-1/4 to yield 5.97 pct at issue.     This compared with the last issue which had a 5-3/4 pct coupon priced at 99-3/4 pct for a yield of 5.75 pct.     But dealers said the terms were not enough to attract foreign investors, and the federal government would have to push yields higher in future if it wanted to borrow again soon.     Sources noted federal government issues had also increased in size, with the introduction of a four billion mark volume only starting last May.     One finance ministry economist said "It isn't more. It's just the size (of each bond) which has increased." He added conditions in the capital market currently remained fairly favourable for raising new debt.     Until recently, federal issues sold very strongly abroad, with up to 90 pct of some being placed with foreign investors.     With the recent stabilisation of the U.S. Dollar, however, foreign investors have begun to back away from the market, as hopes of further currency gains in marks diminish.     Sources said the government has may have already stepped up its borrowing, having raised more than 18 billion marks.     The government made net borrowings of 23 billion marks in 1986. But Bundesbank statistics showed that net borrowing through bonds was 26.6 billion.     The sources said this indicated a move by the government out of other types of debt to gain access to foreign funds through the more acceptable loan stock form.     Although new credit needs were partly inflated by a large amount of issues maturing recently, other factors, including the government's tax reduction program, would also reduce income next year. "The problem here will be the tax reform," the portfolio manager said.     He added that the government's cut in its top income tax rate to 53 pct from 56 pct in 1988 would make it difficult for the government to reduce borrowings.     The sources said the government would fall far short of covering all of its 40 billion marks in lost revenue from the tax reform by making expenditure cuts and would be forced to fall back on debt markets in one form or the other.     The portfolio manager noted that besides the three federal government loan stocks so far this year, it has also fallen back twice to raise a total 6.43 billion marks through the issue of fixed-rate medium-term "Kassenobligation" notes.     A finance ministry economist said the government did not expect to have any trouble keeping to its plan to borrow only a net 22.3 billion marks this year.     Though many sources agreed, they added that the trend would probably not continue next year as the further tax cuts come into effect.     "I would expect the efforts for a further tax reform would mean government borrowing will increase," the manager said.     Bond prices last week were slightly firmer on balance, with the Bundesbank's public authority bond yield calculation falling to 5.64 pct on Friday from 5.66 a week earlier.     But sources said foreign demand for the new federal government loan stock was slack, as sentiment grows that the dollar may now rise against the mark.     "The demand wasn't so good," a dealer for a German bank in London said.     The dollar's recent slight appreciation against the mark even meant that foreign investors have sold mark bonds recently, some dealers said.  REUTER &#3;

Japan will import a total of 4.9 mln tonnes from both areas, up from 4.2 mln a year earlier, they said.

Output increased by 5.6 pct from January 1985 to January 1986 and 0.9 pct from February 1985 to 1986.     The agency said the most recent increase was largely due to last year's poor performance. "No significant improvement was made in economic results," it said, adding that some successes were reported in readjusting the industrial product mix in the last quarter of 1986.     The agency said the amount of tied up working capital rose and sizeable funds were occupied by unsaleable goods in 1986.     It quoted unnamed economists as saying they expect 1987 industrial production to increase at a proper rate and with better results, due to a cost-efficiency drive underway throughout the country.

Japanese customers have bought nearly six mln barrels of crude oil from the National Iranian Oil Company (NIOC) at a substantial discount to the official price, and Western traders have received even larger discounts, Japanese traders involved in the transactions told Reuters.     NIOC has sold its crude for March shipment to Japanese customers with different formulas. One company has bought 800,000 barrels of Iranian Heavy at a straight discount of 30-35 cents below the official price, the sources said.     Other deals have been fixed with prices linked to Oman and Dubai spot prices less a discount, they said.      Iran's discounted sales have not, however, managed to reverse the bullish tone in the crude oil and products spot markets, oil traders said.     Market sentiment is being influenced more by the colder weather in Europe, and reports that OPEC's February output was below its self-imposed quota of 15.8 mln barrels per day.     Firmer gas oil on the London futures, and more bullish sentiment on the New York Mercantile Exchange futures market are supporting spot price levels, they said.      Another Japanese trading house has paid the official price but through a processing arrangement will effectively receive a discount, the sources said. "It's just disguised cheating," one Japanese trader said.     The sources said only one Japanese company had paid the official price for Iranian oil. It has purchased 1.5 mln barrels of Iranian Heavy for April shipment for refining in Singapore. They said about nine VLCCs of Iranian crude have been sold to Western traders with pricing based 60 pct on the official price and 40 pct on spot prices, or with part of the price related to processing arrangements.  &#3;

The offer and withdrawal rights are to expire April Three unless extended, and the bid is to be followed by a merger at the same price.     USAir said Piedmont has granted it an irrevocable option to buy up to 3,491,030 new shares under certain circumstances. Piedmont now has about 18.6 mln shares outstanding.     USAir said the tender is conditioned on receipt of enough shares to give USAir at least a 50.1 pct interest in Piedmont on a fully diluted basis and approval by the U.S. Department of Transportation of a voting trust agreement permitting USAir to buy and hold shares pending review of its application to gain control of Piedmont.     The company said its merger agreement with Piedmont provides that the offer is not to be amended without Piedmont's prior written consent in any way that would be adverse to Piedmont shareholders, but it said it could cut the number of shares to be bought without Piedmont's consent.     USAir said it could reduce the number of Piedmont shares to be purchased in the offer to no less than the minimum number needed to cause the voting trust condition of the bid to be satisfied.     In that case, it said if more than that minimum number of shares were tendered, it would buy shares on a pro rata basis.

trade,gnp,bop,dlr	OECD TRADE, GROWTH SEEN SLOWING IN 1987 .  The 24 nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), hampered by sluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economic growth, and their joint balance of payments will swing into deficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said.     The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD economic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a 2.8 pct growth forecast in December.     It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the smaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardest hit by currency appreciation this year.     The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth rate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in December and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan.     It said it expected the OECD to post a current account deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due in large part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices.     It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely to fall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in 1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986.     It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year.     The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50 dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18 dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes increasingly ragged.     It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in foreign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on its trade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last year's 18.4 pct drop. The average mark/dollar rate is put at 1.80 marks this year and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said.     "This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeper angle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball rather than a three-point landing," the EIU said.     "Talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and the February meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighter U.S. Fsical policy," it said.     It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was the willingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss.     "Thus far they have been willing," the EIC said, adding that if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. bonds the dollar would collapse.     To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rates would have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debt crisis, it said.     On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look "increasingly sick."     Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seen slowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to 4.2 pct in 1988, it said.     The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest single factor, with import growth there expected to feature a sluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in December, the EIU said.     On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in West Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, while Japan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S. Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, more competitively-priced dollar.     It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials and oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986.  Reuter &#3;
interest,money-fx,dlr	POEHL SAYS FURTHER RATE CUT POSSIBLE - SOURCES .  Bundesbank president Karl Otto Poehl told a closed investment symposium that West Germany could cut leading interest rates again if the United States makes a similar move, banking sources said.     The sources were reporting Poehl's remarks at a symposium in Duesseldorf last week organised by Deutsche Bank Ag. Press representatives were not invited.     The sources, speaking separately, said Poehl told about 200 bankers in reply to questions that a cut in U.S. Interest rates would give room for a matching measure in Germany.     "It was a definite hint at lower German interest rates," said one banker who attended the symposium.     A Bundesbank spokesman said the central bank would have no comment on the reported remarks, made at the private meeting.     But, according to a second source, who also declined to be identified, Poehl's comments were seen by bankers present as a direct pointer to further moves by the central bank to defend German industry from an additional revaluation of the mark.     "He said if the Americans drop their interest rates then the Bundesbank would also drop them. He said that quite clearly," the second source said.     In reply to questions, Poehl also said the half-point cut in the discount and Lombard rates on January 22 came after the U.S. Had signalled it would be prepared to attend a meeting to discuss the level of the dollar on condition Germany made such a move in advance, the sources said.     Asked if American authorities could have been persuaded, by cuts in German rates, to come to the bargaining table as early as last September, one of the sources quoted Poehl as saying, "No, they wouldn't have been. We checked that."     The Paris meeting of the Group of Six industrial nations took place exactly one month after the German cut in rates.     Poehl emphasised in his comments the very close talks between central banks before and after the G-6 meeting, saying that financial markets had not fully realised the significance of the Paris session and the U.S. Agreement to stem further falls in the value of the dollar, the sources said.     For the first time all participants at the summit agreed that a further fall in the dollar would be harmful for all world economies, including the U.S., Poehl had said.     The sources said the tone of Poehl's comments boosted growing sentiment that the dollar would be stabilised around current levels by international central bank cooperation.     One source said Poehl's remarks also underlined the fact that the Bundesbank was now more prepared to be accommodative in monetary policy in order to prevent a further slowdown in West Germany's economic growth.     Poehl and other Bundesbank officials have in the past stressed that the German central bank had no direct responsibility for growth and was solely concerned with combatting inflation.     This led, for instance, to the introduction of a tighter monetary stance from the beginning of December until the half-point cut in rates in late January.     The sources quoted Poehl as saying that the current overshooting of the German monetary target would not directly respark inflation. The Bundesbank was not obliged to react immediately whenever such overshooting occurs.     Latest data for central bank money stock, the Bundesbank's main measure of money supply, showed the measure was growing at 7-1/2 pct in January, outside its three to six pct 1987 target.     Share prices rose in very active trading today, with dealers reporting that Poehl's remarks, coupled with a bullish outlook on stock prices from Deutsche at the same symposium, brought in strong bargain hunting at current low levels.

acq	SOSNOFF STARTS BID FOR CAESARS WORLD &lt;CAW> .  &lt;MTS Acquisition Corp>, a company formed by Martin T. Sosnoff, said it has started a tender offer for all shares of Caesars World Inc at 28 dlrs each.     In a newspaper advertisement, MTS said the offer and withdrawal rights expire April Three unless extended.     Sosnoff, a New York investor, already owns about four mln of Caesars' 30.3 mln shares outstanding, or about 13.3 pct, and is Caesars' largest shareholder.  Caesars owns casino hotels in Nevada and honeymoon resorts in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains.  It also controls Caesars New Jersey Inc &lt;CJN>, which owns an Atlantic City, N.J., casino hotel.     For the second quarter ended January 31, Caesars World earned 12.6 mln dlrs on revenues of 190.4 mln dlrs, up from earnings of 7,500,000 dlrs and revenues of 163.8 mln dlrs a year before.  For all of fiscal 1986, the company earned 41.0 mln dlrs on revenues of 694.4 mln dlrs.     MTS said the offer is conditioned on receipt of at least enough shares to give Sosnoff a majority interest on a fully diluted basis, the arrangement of sufficient financing to buy all Caesars shares not already owned and pay related costs and approval by the New Jersey Casino control Commission and the NEvada Gaming Commission and State Gaming Control Board.     MTS said Marine Midland Banks Inc &lt;MM> has committed to lend it 100 mln dlrs for the acquisition and use its best efforts to syndicate another 400 mln dlrs in senior financing for the transaction.     It said its financial adviser, PaineWebber Group Inc &lt;PWJ>, has stated in writing that subject to market conditions, it is highly confident that it can arrange commitments for up to 475 mln dlrs in "mezzanine" financing.     MTS said it does not expect problems in obtaining New Jersey and Nevada regulatory approval for the acquisition, since ownership in a Caesars stake has already been cleared.     In June 1986, Sosnoff requested a seat on the Caesars World board, a request that has not yet been granted.  In September 1986, Sosnoff, who is chairman of &lt;Atalanta/Sosnoff Capital Corp>, filed for clearance under U.S. antitrust laws to raise his interest in Caesars World to 25 pct.     Sosnoff said, in a letter to Caesars World chairman and chief executive officer Henry Gluck, that "The decision to go directly to the shareholders was made at the urging of may financial and legal advisors, who repeatedly stressed to me the lack of responsiveness of the management in the past."     Sosnoff, who said he has made numerous efforts to express his views to management on ways of maximizing shareholder values, said Caesars twicce refused his request for a board seat.  "My advisers felt that, had I given you advance notice, you would have used the time to throw up obstacles to my offer rather than giving it serious consideration," he said.     Sosnoff said he hopes that Caesars World management will be willing to negotiate an acquisition agreement with him.     "As I have indicated publicly in the past, I believe operating management of the company has performed well and that appropriate consideration should be given to a significant equity interest for them in the company following the acquisition," Sosnoff said in the letter to Gluck.     MTS said Sosnoff has asked the company to fix March 27 as the record date for the determination of shareholders entitled to authorize action without a meeting -- including the election or removal of directors.

gnp,jobs,cpi,bop,dfl	DUTCH PLANNING AGENCY FORECASTS LOWER GROWTH .  Dutch economic growth is slowing as a firming guilder cuts competitiveness abroad and industries reduce the pace of investment, the Dutch official planning agency CPB said.     The Centraal Planbureau, publishing its 1987 economic outlook, said Dutch Net National Income (NNI) was expected to grow by one pct this year, down from two pct growth recorded in 1986 and 2.5 pct in 1985 and 1984.     Dutch Gross National Product is expected to rise to 432.20 billion guilders in 1987 in constant prices, a two pct increase from last year's 423.95 billion.     The CPB, forecasting an 8.5 pct increase in the value of the guilder on a trade-weighted basis compared with 10.0 pct last year, said the dollar was expected to trade at an average of 2.0 guilders in 1987 compared with 2.45 guilders in 1986.     "The higher guilder is causing a substantial fall in unit labour costs abroad, when measured in guilder terms, while these are rising slightly in the Netherlands," the CPB said.     More of economic growth now depended on domestic consumption, the CPB said, but noting that higher margins set by domestic producers and importers mitigated the effect on purchasing power of lower import costs and deflation.     Consumer prices were set to fall by 1.5 pct this year, the CPB said. Inflation was zero last year.     Gross investment in industry was expected to grow by five pct this year, a slowdown compared with 11.5 pct growth last year, the CPB said.     Exchange rate and oil price fluctuations will continue to condition the Dutch economy in the future as it has in recent years, the CPB said, noting a continued depressing impact of these factors on Dutch competitiveness.     In addition, it noted a slight rise in taxation and social security costs to employers.     The CPB, forecasting a rise in the budget deficit to 7.2 pct of Net National Income in 1987 from 6.3 pct last year, urged the government to cut expenditure further to bring down the deficit and reduce tax and social security payments in future.     Dutch government revenue is being depressed further by falling income from natural gas sales in 1987, the CPB said.     It said unemployment was expected to fall to 675,000 this year from 710,000 last year.     While the two pct GDP growth forecast set by the CPB is within its latest forecast, issued last month, of 1.5 to two pct growth, the figure is well above recent market estimates.     Dutch merchant bank Pierson, Heldring en Pierson said in its February economic outlook that GDP growth at constant prices was expected to be 1.1 pct this year and market analysts had expected the CPB's final forecast to be below its own latest estimate.     "It is too early to comment because I haven't seen the whole document yet, but it would seem we are more pessimistic in some of our estimates," a Pierson economist said.     The CPB forecast 2.5 pct export growth in volume terms in 1987, after four pct growth last year. Excluding energy exports, the 1987 figure would be two pct, it said.     Imports were set to rise by 4.5 pct this year compared with four pct in 1986 in volume terms, the CPB said.     The balance of payments would see a sharp decline in the surplus, to six billion guilders in 1987 compared with 12.1 billion last year, the CPB forecast.  REUTER &#3;

The company also said it will receive a qualified opinion from the auditors of it 1986 financial statement subject to the outcome of two suits. The company is a defendant in a consolidated class action law suit which seeks damages in an unspecified amount and is also a defendant in a related shareholder action.     Iomega said the auditors state in their opinion letter that both actions are in the early stages of discovery and the likely outcome can not be determined at this time.     The company said a corporate wide reduction of its professional, management and indirect labor will result in the permanent elimination of 183 positions in all functional areas of the company's business. This represents over 25 pct of professional, management and indirect employees, it added.     In addition, Iomega announced layoff of about 182 employees, principally from its manufacturing direct labor force. Those affected represent about 46 pct of direct labor.     Commenting on the layoffs, Iomega said those from among the direct labor force affects personnel building the Alpha Eight Inch Disk Drive and Bernoulli Boxes.     "This action is required as we bring our finished goods inventory and inventory in our distribution channels down to acceptable levels," it explained.     The company stated this layoff does not affect the production of its new 5-1/4 inch Beta 20 product which is currently being built to a backlog of orders.  Reuter &#3;
ship	BRAZIL SEAMEN CONTINUE STRIKE DESPITE COURT .  Hundreds of marines were on alert at 11 key Brazilian ports after 40,000 seamen decided to remain on indefinite strike, even after the Higher Labour Court Saturday ruled it illegal, union leaders said.     The halt, the first national strike by seamen in 25 years, started on February 27, and union leaders said they would not return to work unless they got a 275 pct pay rise. Shipowners have offered a 100 per cent raise, which the seamen rejected.     "We have nothing to lose. If they want to lay off the workers, fine, but we are determined to carry on with our protest until the end," a union leader said.  more     He said they had decided in a meeting that if the marines take over the ships, the seamen would abandon the vessels and let the marines handle the situation by themselves.     A spokesman for the Rio de Janeiro Port said the order to send marines to take over the ports was given by Navy Minister Henrique Saboya on grounds that ports are areas of national security. But he said there were no incidents. The strike has cut exports and imports and made an estimated 160 ships idle.     Petrol station owners in four states also continued their shutdown and there were fears that the combination of the two stoppages could lead to a serious fuel shortage.  Reuter &#3;
money-fx,gnp	BONN SERIOUS ABOUT CURRENCY PACT, SAYS TIETMEYER .  West Germany takes "very seriously" the recent undertaking by major industrial countries to promote exchange rate stability around current levels, Finance Ministry State Secretary Hans Tietmeyer said.     Talking to journalists before a meeting of European Community Economy and Finance Ministers here, Tietmeyer declined to say whether the February 22 Paris accord by the Group of Five countries plus Canada included secret agreements for stabilising currencies.     But he noted the official communique said the participants agreed to cooperate closely to foster stability of exchange rates around current levels. "We're taking this sentence very seriously," he said.     Tietmeyer remarked that the dollar had hardly moved against the mark since the meeting.     He said a slowdown in West German economic growth had been caused by sharp exchange rate swings and that the Paris agreement should help in this respect.     Economics Ministry State Secretary Otto Schlecht said the Bonn government saw no current need for measures to bolster the economy but was paying close attention to the slower growth and had not ruled out "appropriate and timely" action if necessary.     Schlecht and Tietmeyer were speaking ahead of a discussion by the EC ministers of the latest EC Commission report on the economic situation in the 12-nation bloc.     The Commission has sharply revised down expected German gross national product growth this year to two pct from 3.2 pct predicted last autumn and says Bonn has the most room of any EC country to stimulate economic activity.     Schlecht said the upturn in West Germany's economy slowed in the fourth quarter of last year and the first quarter of 1987. But he said there was no cumulative downwards trend in view that would make quick remedial action necessary.     He said a number of favourable indicators such as high level of investment and a good climate for consumption meant a recovery could be expected, while exports would pick up slightly during the course of the year.

coffee	UGANDA DISAPPOINTED BY COFFEE TALKS FAILURE .  Uganda, Africa's second largest coffee producer, was disappointed by the stalemate in recent coffee talks in London, the chairman of the state-run Coffee Marketing Board, CMB, said.     "This has not been good for coffee producers, more so in a situation where the prices dropped by 200 pounds per tonne of robusta coffee," J. Makumbi said when he returned from London on Friday.     Producers and consumers failed to agree on a quota formula to share the world's coffee production during International Coffee Organisation, ICO, talks that ended last week.     Makumbi blamed the failure to set quotas, which were suspended in Feburary last year, on Indonesian demands that its quota be increased dramatically.     Uganda -- which earns about 400 mln dlrs annually from coffee exports, over 95 pct of its foreign exchange earnings -- had sought to raise its ICO quota to 3.0 mln from 2.45 mln 60-kilo bags, according to sources close to the CMB.     The CMB has estimated that production will rise 20 to 25 pct in the current 1986/87 October-September season to over three mln bags.     For several years Uganda had been unable to meet its ICO export quota as rebel activity disrupted the coffee industry.     The Ugandan government depends on coffee export duties for about 60 pct of its sales tax revenue and the industry employs over half of salaried manpower.     In Dar es Salaam, Tanzania's Agriculture and Livestock Development Minister Paul Bomani said today Third World countries would suffer from the failure of the London coffee talks.     "It is only the middlemen who will benefit, he said.     Bomani called on the ICO to convene another meeting within two months, saying, "Once tempers have cooled and delegations have had time to report back to their headquarters, common sense will prevail."

crude	ECUADOR TO EXPORT NO OIL FOR 4 MONTHS, OFFICIAL .  The suspension of Ecuador's crude oil shipments after an earthquake cut an oil pipeline will last at least four months, a senior Energy Ministry official said.     The official said Ecuador could resume exports after repairing a 40 km section of the 510 km pipeline, which links jungle oil fields at Lago Agrio to Balao on the Pacific coast. It would take about 100 mln U.S. Dlrs to repair the pipeline, the official, who did not want to be named, told Reuters. Ecuador had enough oil to meet domestic demand for about 35 days and would have to import crude to supplement stocks.     The earthquake last Thursday night registered six on the 12-point international Mercalli scale. The damage to the pipeline was a severe economic blow to Ecuador, where oil accounts for up to two-thirds of total exports and as much as 60 pct of government revenues.     Financially pressed Ecuador, a member of the Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC), was recently pumping about 260,000 barrels per day (bpd) of crude, about 50,000 bpd above the output quota assigned by the cartel, another Energy Ministry spokesman said. Last year, it exported an average of 173,500 bpd, according to the central bank.     However, Ecuador might build an emergency 25 km pipeline, costing 15 to 20 mln dlrs, to hook up with a Colombian pipeline, the first official said. He estimated it could take about 60 days to build.     Ecuador, squeezed by the slide in world oil prices in 1986, had only 138 mln dlrs in net international reserves at the end of January, about equal to one month's imports.     It suspended interest payments in January on 5.4 billion dlrs owed to about 400 private foreign banks. The country's total foreign debt is 8.16 billion dlrs, the eighth largest in Latin America.     In Caracas, President Jaime Lusinchi said Venezuela would loan five mln barrels of crude to Ecuador over the next three months to make up for losses from damage to the pipeline.     Ecuador asked for the loan to guarantee domestic supplies and would ship an equivalent volume back to Venezuela in repayment in May, Lusinchi said.     A commission headed by Venezuelan Investment Fund Minister Hector Hurtado and including representatives from the interior and defence ministries and the state oil company Petroleos de Venezuela will travel to Ecuador Tuesday to evaluate and co-ordinate an emergency relief program, he said.

Renault President Raymond Levy said in a statement issued by the French state car group the agreement was an important stage in Renault's redeployment. "It will allow Renault to continue its export programme to the U.S. And also opens a perspective of cooperation with a major American constructor," the statement said. Under the terms of the letter of intent, Chrysler will purchase Renault's stake held in the form of bonds and shares.     The Renault statement quoted Chrysler Chairman Lee Iacocca as saying, "We welcome AMC shareholders into the Chrysler family."     He added that the accord would allow Renault and Chrysler to study the development of future products destined to be distributed by Renault and Chrysler in the North American and world markets.     "Renault is a leader in our industry and I am happy to be working with them," Iacocca was quoted as saying.     Chrysler will pay for Renault's AMC interests held in bonds by a 200 mln dlr bond and will pay up to 350 mln dlrs for Renault share interests, depending on AMC sales and future profits, the Renault statement said.     The statement said the agreement in principle gave each side 30 days to put together a definitive accord. Approval would also be necessary from the Renault, Chrysler and AMC boards, from AMC shareholders and the relevant government authorities.     If the deal goes ahead, the statement said, AMC shareholders other than Renault will receive Chrysler shares for each of their shares valued at four dlrs.     AMC shareholders with convertible preferential shares will have the possibility to exchange them for Chrysler shares on the same conditions as those they would have had in exchanging them for AMC shares.

earn	SOUTHERN &lt;SO> TO TAKE CHARGE ON VOGTLE COST .  Southern Co said it will take an after-tax charge of 226 mln dlrs against earnings no later than January 1988 because the projected cost of the Vogtle nuclear power plant has risen abover the amount which retail customers in Georgia will be asked to pay.     The company's largest subsidiary, Georgia Power Co, said the budget for the plant has increased by 6.3 pct, or 522 mln dlrs, to 8.87 billion. However, because of a pledge the made last year to Georgia's Public Service Commission, the increased cost will not be included in the utility's retail electric rates.     Geogia Power also said its board has delayed the scheduled completion of Vogtle's Unit Two to June 1989 from September 1988. Unit Two is about 60 pct complete, it added.     The utility said fuel loading has been completed at Unit One and the unit is being put through a series of low-power tests before the Nuclear Regulatory Commission is asked for a full-power license.     The nuclear power plant, located near Waynesboro, Ga., is co-owned by &lt;Oglethorpe Power Corp>, the Municipal Electric Authority of Georgia and the city of Dalton.     Georgia Power said the revised Vogtle budget estimate was due to several factors, including additional labor costs incurred to keep the plant's first unit on schedule for commercial operation by June. The new figure represents the first change in the plant's budget since August 1985, when it was estimated at 8.35 billion dlrs.     In March 1986, the utility told Georgia regulators it would "cap" the price of Vogtle its customers would be asked to pay at 3.56 billion dlrs, the company's share of the then projected 8.35 billion dlr total. Under the new budget, Georgia Power said, its share amounts to 3.87 billion dlrs.     Noting that Georgia Power's share of the Vogtle increase is 313 mln dlrs, Southern said this will result in a charge against earnings of 177 mln dlrs after taxes.     In addition, the company said, Georgia Power's contracts with the joint owners require the utility to buy back significant amounts of Vogtle capacity during the plant's initial years of operation. Under terms of the cap on costs, it will not attempt to recover the portion of the budget increase that applies to the buybacks.     This bings the total amount that must be charged against earnings to 2326 mln dlrs after taxes, Southern said.     Southern said new rules of the Financial Accounting Standards Board, which are effective in January 1988, require any costs that are determined nonrecoverable to be charged against earnings once that determination is made.     The company also said its board has approved a capital budget of 2.1 billion dlrs in 1987, including work on the Vogtle project.     It said a 5.9 billion dlr capita budget for the three-year period 1987-1989 was also outlined at the board meeting, noting this is 700 mln dlrs below the comparable figure for the years 1986-1988.

trade,bop,money-fx,crude,gnp,dlr	OECD TRADE, GROWTH SEEN SLOWING IN 1987 .  The 24 nations of the Organisation for Economic Cooperation and Development (OECD), hampered by sluggish industrial output and trade, face slower economic growth, and their joint balance of payments will swing into deficit in 1987, the Economist Intelligence Unit (EIU ) said.     The EIU said in its World Trade Forecast it revised OECD economic growth downwards to 2.5 pct this year, compared with a 2.8 pct growth forecast in December.     It said the new areas of weakness are West Germany and the smaller European countries it influences, and Japan, hardest hit by currency appreciation this year.     The independent research organisation cut its 1987 growth rate forecasts for West Germany to 2.2 pct from 3.2 pct in December and to 2.3 pct from three pct for Japan.     It said it expected the OECD to post a current account deficit of some 13 billion dlrs in both 1987 and 1988, due in large part to a 1.50 dlrs a barrel rise in 1987 oil prices.     It said the U.S. Current account deficit looked likely to fall even more slowly than forecast, to 125 billion dlrs in 1987 and 115 billion in 1988 from 130 billion in 1986.     It said it expected West Germany to post a 31 billion dlr payments surplus and Japan a 76 billion dlr surplus this year.     The EIU said it saw oil prices dropping to around 16.50 dlrs a barrel by end-1987 and 15.50 dlrs in 1988 from about 18 dlrs last year, as adherence to OPEC output policy becomes increasingly ragged.     It said the dollar is poised to resume its decline in foreign exchange markets, and will lose a further 13 pct on its trade-weighted index this year and five pct in 1988 after last year's 18.4 pct drop.     The average mark/dollar rate is put at 1.80 marks this year and 1.70 in 1988 while the yen/dollar rate is expected to break through the 150 yen barrier with an average value of 150 yen in 1987 and 146 yen in 1988, it said.     "This is not a crash scenario but the dollar's steeper angle of descent increases the risk of ending with a fireball rather than a three-point landing," the EIU said.     "Talking will not stop the dollar's slide for long and the February meeting (of finance ministers of the Group of Five and Canada) produced scant promise of either a decisive shift to more expansive policies in West Germany and Japan, or a tighter U.S. Fiscal policy," it said.     It said the key to the dollar's fortunes was the willingness of Japanese institutions to buy U.S. Government assets despite prospects of sustaining a currency loss.     "Thus far they have been willing," the EIC said, adding that if Japan was deterred from buying U.S. Bonds the dollar would collapse.     To contain such a currency crisis, dollar interest rates would have to soar, bringing recession and a Third World debt crisis, it said.     On trade, the EIU said prospects for 1987 look "increasingly sick."     Import growth, forecast in December at 4.5 pct, is now seen slowing down to around 3.8 pct in 1987 with a recovery only to 4.2 pct in 1988, it said.     The weakness of the West German economy is the biggest single factor, with import growth there expected to feature a sluggish 3.5 pct growth in 1987 against the 6.5 pct forecast in December, the EIU said.     On the export side, it said it saw weak demand in West Germany affecting export prospects elsewhere in Europe, while Japan's exports in 1987 would remain flat and sales by U.S. Exporters would respond only marginally to a lower, more competitively-priced dollar.     It said in most of Europe and in Japan, raw materials and oil will cost less in domestic currency in 1987 than in 1986.     However, rates of inflation will edge up in 1988 to over the current OECD average of three pct. Non-oil commodity prices will show a modest dollar price increase in 1988 for the first time since 1984, the EIU said.     After a rise of 18 pct in 1986, the dollar price of internationally traded manufactures will go up by 8.5 pct in 1987 and by five pct in 1988, it said.     It said OECD industrial production would rise by only 1.6 pct in 1987 after a weak 1.5 pct increase in 1986.  Reuter &#3;

The bank also cut its seven-day repossession rate to 8-1/2 pct from 8-3/4 pct.     The intervention rate has stood at eight pct since it was raised from 7-1/4 pct on January 2 as the French franc came under pressure ahead of the EMS realignment on January 11.     The bank said the purchase, effective tomorrow, is for five pct of private paper and fixed rate Treasury bills maturing between March 25 and June 25 and of other Treasury bills maturing between March 25, 1987 and March 25, 1989.     The rate cut had been expected since the bank announced a money market intervention tender earlier today.     Money market dealers said conditions seemed right for a quarter percentage point cut, reflecting an easing in the call money rate last week, and the French franc's steadiness on foreign exchange markets since the February 22 currency stabilisation accord here by the Group of Five and Canada.

The initial distribution will be in cumulative redeemable retractable floating rate class A preferred shares series II, which will carry a retraction right enabling holders to receive 12.75 dlrs for each share.     Continental said the 58.6 mln dlrs of existing outstanding preferred shares will be paid off at par plus accrued dividends.      Continental said the notes will carry a dividend rate of 72 pct of prime and it expects that the shares will trade at 12.75 dlrs or more, enabling shareholders who wish to receive cash to do so.     The bank said it expects the distribution will be made in early May, subject to various approvals.     Continental also said that, as of March 2, it had cash of more than 250 mln dlrs and equity of about 284.6 mln dlrs, allowing for a final total distribution of 16.60 dlrs per common share.     Continental Bank said it continues to expect that the final distribution to shareholders will be in the range of 16.50 dlrs to 17.25 dlrs per share and will take place in late 1988 or early 1989.     Until the initial stock distribution takes place, regular dividend payments will be maintained on the existing preferred shares, the bank said.     The distribution is part of the terms of Continental Bank of Canada's sale of its banking assets to Lloyds Bank Canada, a subsidiary of Lloyds Bank PLC.     Continental Bank said Lloyds Bank Canada paid the balance of the purchase price but that it was lower than originally anticipated since Continental was unable to transfer certain income tax deductions to Lloyds Bank.

trade	STUDY SAYS U.S., CANADA PACT WOULD SPUR ECONOMIES .  A free trade pact between the United States and Canada could spur the economies of both sides substantially, according to a study released by the Institute for International Economics.     The study, by Paul Wonnacott, said a successful conclusion to the free trade talks now under way could raise Canada's gross national product by more than five pct and expand U.S. export's by about seven pct.     He said the pact could resolve the knotty issue of government subsidies, end curbs on trade in services and investments and pave the way for new global talks under the  General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.     The United States and Canada - the world's two biggest trading partners with cross border shipments of about 150 billion dlrs a year - opened free trade talks last June. They are aiming for a pact by next October.     Wonnacott, an economics professor at the Univerity of Maryland, said an agreement should include:     - Elimination of tariffs between the two countries, phased in over a five to 10-year period;     - Equal access to federal government procurement in the two countries, replacing current "Buy America" and "Buy Canada" provisions with a "Buy North America" provision;     - Fewer restrictions in trade in services, chiefly finance and transportation;     - A commitment not to screen foreign investments in favor domestic producers;     - A commission to resolve bilateral trade disputes.      Wonnacott said that to resolve the subsidy problem, the two sides should permit export subsidies of exports of up to 2.0 or 2.5 pct without imposing coutervailing duties.     The limit on subsidies is now 0.5 pct.     He proposed that any attempt to impose new duties to offset subsidies should go first a special disputes commission for resolution at an early stage.     Wonnacott said "bilateral free trade would contribute to the efficiency of the North American economies and to their competitiveness in facing overseas producers.     He said it would it would open U.S. markets to Canadian goods and enable them to benefit from the economies of mass production.     Benefits to the United States would be fewer than those to Canada proportionately, he said, because of the already large U.S. gross national product.     Wonnacott said also that a U.S.-Canada pact in such areas as export subsidies and the creation of a dispute commission could set an example for the current attempt by GATT to write new and more liberal global trading regulations.

No timetable was given.     Members of the three exchanges have been consulted, Agricultural Futures Exchange secretary Bill Englebright told Reuters, and no objections have been raised to the merger.     Three markets are involved at present but the new exchange could ultimately combine five markets.     Discussions are taking place with the Baltic International Freight Futures Exchange, BIFFEX, and the GAFTA London Grain Futures Market is considering the possibility of joining the other markets, market officials said.     The BIFFEX board is expected to reach a decision on the merger at its meeting at the end of this month, after members are consulted at a meeting on March 16.     The grain futures market also intends to consult its members soon, GAFTA director general James Mackie said.     The aim of the amalgamation is to limit regulatory and administrative costs and achieve the recognition required under the 1986 Financial Services Act. This legislation requires a futures market to become a Recognised Investment Exchange, RIE, for trading to continue.     Representatives of all the futures markets on the Baltic Exchange have been discussing the possibility of a single RIE structure since the beginning of the year.     The new exchange now planned will apply to the Securities and Investments Board for recognition as an RIE "at the appropriate time," the Agricultural Futures Exchange said.

Renewal of the KHJ-TV license has been challenged in regulatory proceedings for more than 20 years.

The FCC has not said when it would rule on the appeals, according to a spokemsan for Akron, Ohio-based Gencorp.     Fidelity Television originally filed a competing application for the RKO license for KHJ, an independent station, in 1965.     In 1980, the FCC disqualified RKO as licensee of WNAC-TV in Boston, citing anti-competitive trade practices and inaccurate financial reporting to the agency, causing renewals previously granted to RKO in New York, for WOR, and Los Angeles, for KHJ, to be denied.

Sterling remained firm around 1.59 dlrs compared with its close here on Friday at 1.5865 dlrs.  REUTER &#3;

interest	U.K. ISSUES ONE BILLION STG BOND TRANCHE .  The Bank of England said it was taking onto its books a further one billion stg tranche of 8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan stock due 1997, payable 40 stg pct on application. The stock was issued to the Bank at 96.50 stg pct and will be available for dealings from March 11, with the remainder of the amount payable on May 5. The Bank said the bonds would yield 9.28 pct at the issue price and would be free of tax to residents overseas. The issue would be designated 8-3/4 pct Treasury Loan 1997 "B."  A further 100 mln stg was reserved for the National Debt Commissioners.     The market dropped by up to 1/2 point following the Bank's announcement, with the Treasury 13-1/2 pct stock due 2004/08 quoted one full point lower at 134-12/32 stg pct around 20 minutes after the news.     Dealers said the announcement had to be viewed against the backdrop of intense pressure for lower U.K. Interest rates which had built up over the past two weeks as a result of sterling's strength.     The Bank this morning finally signalled it was prepared to see lower rates and U.K. Clearing banks this afternoon announced cuts in their base lending rates to 10.5 pct from 11 pct.     The Bank had initially been reluctant to countenance a rate cut because, dealers said, the authorities had wished to delay a reduction until around the time of the U.K. Budget on March 17, thereby preserving the full impact of Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson's package of measures.     However, in the face of sterling's apparently inexorable climb, the authorities today decided to cede to pressure and allow a half-point cut.     Today's one billion stg tap issue was viewed by the market as a move by the Bank to eradicate hopes for a further early rate cut which might arise as a result of strong sterling.     Most market participants believe that Lawson will now foster a further half point interest rate reduction at the time of the budget, although one or two said they would not be surprised to see a full point decline at this stage.     Dealers noted that as part of the authorities' attempts last week to ease pressure for lower rates, the Bank had issued a one billion stg tap stock with a view to subduing the Government bond market.     To the surprise of most participants, the issue was sold out within hours of becoming available for trading and the market pushed on to register further sharp gains.     Dealers said that at this stage it seemed unlikely that the issue announced today would be absorbed by the market as rapidly as last week's.     However, they noted that although sterling had edged down from its highs following the base rate cut, it had still closed on a trade-weighted basis at 72.4, well ahead of Friday's final 71.8 and only just beneath the peak of 72.5 touched at 1300 GMT.

crude	PETRO-CANADA TO DRILL TWO TERRA NOVA TEST WELLS .  Petro-Canada, Canada's state-owned oil company, said it will drill two delineation wells this summer at the Terra Nova oil field offshore Newfoundland.     Evaluation of test results and preliminary engineering work should put Petro-Canada in a position to propose a development plan for the Terra Nova field in 1988, the company said.     Depending on time required for regulatory approvals, construction could begin in 1989, with first oil production as early as 1991, Petro-Canada said.     "We have a high degree of confidence that the western portion of the (Terra Nova) field contains at least 11 mln cubic meters of recoverable oil, or more than 70 mln barrels, and that we could produce it economicly using a floating production system," Petro-Canada said.     The Terra-Nova field, lying 350 kilometers east of St. John's and 35 kilometers southeast of Hibernia field, was discovered by Petro-Canada in 1984.     "We've had encouraging results from the eastern portion of the field, and we hope this summer's drilling will prove up additional reserves there," the company said.     Petro-Canada believes Terra Nova field is a good commercial prospect and the company wants to move some of those resources towards development so it can start generating a return on investments, Petro-Canada said.     Petro-Canada, which will act as operator of the two wells, has a 75 pct interest in the western portion of Graven block of the Terra Nova field and a 26 pct interest in the field's East Flank block, a company spokesman said later. Other field participants include Canterra Energy Ltd, Mobil Oil Canada Ltd, Gulf Canada Resources Inc, ICG Resources Ltd, Trillium Exploration Corp and general partnership PAREX.     Petro-Canada estimates reserves in the Terra Nova field's Graven block of between 68 mln and 70 mln barrels of oil, company spokesman Bob Foulkes said from Petro-Canada's Calgary office.     Combined reserves for Graven Block and the field's East Flank block are estimated between 70 mln and 130 mln barrels, he added.     Petro-Canada expects to spend about 500 mln Canadian dlrs to bring the field to production by about 1991, and the development budget could double if the company builds a production system combining both blocks in the field, he said.     Petro-Canada estimates the Terra Nova field Graven block would produce between 25,000 and 26,000 barrels average daily production, with a production system that would have maximum capacity of 40,000 bpd, company spokesman Foulkes said in answer to a query.     The company estimates a production system combining both Graven and East Flank blocks in the Terra Nova field could produce about 45,000 bpd average daily production, he said.  Reuter &#3;

(Charan Industries Inc), a distributor of toys and other consumer products, expects 1987 net profit to rise at least 50 pct over last year's 6.1 mln dlrs, president Earl Takefman told reporters before the annual meeting.     "We grew basically 100 pct last year, I'm not sure we're going to be able to grow 100 pct again this year but we certainly will grow at least 50 pct over last year," Takefman said.     Charan reported profit of 3.0 mln dlrs in 1985.     Takefman said he expects sales to rise to about 100 mln dlrs this year from 57.3 mln dlrs in 1986.     Fiscal 1985 ended September 30, while fiscal 1986 ended November 30.     Takefman said the company is actively looking for acquisitions in the consumer products industry, likely in Canada.     The company said it expects to resolve delivery problems this year which last year hindered the growth of its toy distribution business, which accounts for about one-third of revenues.     Charan is the exclusive distributor in Canada for &lt;Worlds of Wonder> toys, which include the Teddy Ruxpin voice-activated talking plush bear.     Takefman said new products this year, which will be on the shelves for Christmas, include a smaller version of Teddy Ruxpin, a talking Mickey Mouse toy, dancing plush toys, a doll with a voice activated by sound, touch, light and heat, and talking books.     The company is also marketing an extended line of "laser tag" kits, which shoot rays of light and tell you when you've hit someone.     Other products include a recorder device which allows students to leave taped messages in each others' school lockers, retailing for about 60 dlrs.  Reuter &#3;

money-fx,interest	UK MONEY RATES FALL AS BANK APPROVES BASE RATE CUT .  A half point cut in base lending rates was announced by the big four clearing banks today after the Bank of England finally endorsed such a move following weeks of downward pressure, dealers said.     During its routine intervention in the market, the bank trimmed the rates at which it deals with the discount houses by half a point and National Westminster led the other clearing banks in reducing its base rate to 10-1/2 pct from 11 pct.     The timing of the Bank of England move took operators by surprise after its recent action seemingly designed to dampen hopes of a base rate cut ahead of the U.K. Budget on March 17.        For some time, fundamentals have led the market to push for a one point cut in base lending rates to 10 pct but the central bank has declined to follow wholesale money market rates down.     Although political considerations -- the government's wish to see a fall in base rates coincide with the Budget -- had been suggested by operators last week as reasons for the Bank's delaying action, worries about the real strength of sterling and perhaps about the market's reaction to the content of the Budget may have been behind the central bank's caution, dealers said.     In the event, sterling continued firm after the rate cut, leaving the market still looking for another half point fall.     Consequently, rates in the money market eased during the day, one-month interbank sterling shedding 5/16 point to 10-9/16 7/16 and three-months trading 1/16 point down at 10-5/16 3/16 pct. Sterling cd's were similarly down between 5/16 point in one month and 1/8 point in one year.     Overnight interbank money for tomorrow was indicated at around 11 pct, almost a point below the levels ruling at the end of last week. Today, overnight touched a high of some 11-3/4 pct after the Bank took out 228 mln stg of an estimated 300 mln stg shortage.  REUTER &#3;

The U.S. Department of Agriculture will probably decrease its estimate of the 1986/87 Florida orange crop today to as low as 123 mln boxes from 129 mln boxes, analysts and industry sources said.     The Department is scheduled to release the new estimate at 1500 hrs EST (2100 gmt) today.     Analysts said the market is anticipating a downward revision and much of the bullish impact has been discounted.     The estimate, which the USDA has left unchanged since October, should be affected this time by recent evidence of a shortfall in the early and midseason crop now that those harvests are complete. Analysts said based on earlier USDA projections, the harvests should have been five to seven mln boxes larger than they were.     "They are going to cut their estimate," said Bob Tate, an FCOJ broker with Dean Witter Reynolds in Miami. "The only question is whether they will admit the whole thing in this estimate."     Tate said it is possible the USDA will lower its estimate by a lesser amount, perhaps three mln boxes, and continue to drop the estimate in subsequent reports as the crop picture clarifies. The late season harvest, consisting mostly of Valencia oranges, has not yet started, he noted.     "They'll temper it," said Judy Weissman, FCOJ analyst with Shearson Lehman Bros. "The main drop will probably come in July."     She expects today's estimate will be 126 mln boxes.  Reuter &#3;

rubber	RUBBER PRODUCERS, CONSUMERS START NEW PACT TALKS .  The chairman of the conference on a new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA), Manaspas Xuto of Thailand, said it was imperative to try to settle the main outstanding issues this week.     The INRA renegotiation conference, which resumed today under the auspices of the United Nations Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD), is scheduled to last until March 20.     Xuto told delegates this session of the conference presented a promising opportunity to conclude a new pact but it had to be the last before the current accord expires in October.     Xuto said in his consultations with representatives of major exporting and importing countries over the last few months, "I have found a constructive attitude and willingness to be flexible on the part of all concerned."     "It is imperative that we try to settle the major outstanding issues in the course of this week, since a considerable amount of technical drafting work will remain to be completed." He said he will immediately start consultations with producers and consumers.     The last October negotiations collapsed in disagreement over buffer stock operations.     Consumer demands for tighter buffer stock controls, aimed at preventing INRA from following the collapse of the International Tin Agreement (ITA), were rejected by producers who argued for unchanged INRA terms.     The tin pact failed when its buffer stock manager ran out of funds to support prices.     Three previous rounds of talks between rubber producers and consumers for a new five-year pact ended without agreement. The INRA, originally due to expire in October 1985, was extended to October 1987 to facilitate renegotiation.     Wong Kum Choon, head of the Malaysian delegation, said he was cautiously optimistic "that together we should be able to save INRA and prevent it from being scuttled."     Without INRA, he added, prices of natural rubber would become more volatile.     Calling on delegates to show a sense of purpose and reality, he said, "There is no reason why we could not put aside differences and come up with a successor agreement."  Reuter &#3;

The rating agency cited USAir Group's proposed acquisition of Piedmont Aviation Inc &lt;PIE>, as well as Trans World Airlines Inc's &lt;TWA> proposed cash merger with USAir.     However, the status of TWA's bid for USAir Group is currently uncertain. The U.S. Transportation Department has rejected TWA's application to acquire USAir on deficiency grounds, but TWA has said it will file a revised application, Moody's noted.     Under Moody's review for possible downgrade are USAir Group's Baa-1 senior debt and Baa-2 subordinated debentures, along with the USAir unit's A-3 senior debt and Baa-1 subordinated debentures.     Moody's said it would examine the effects of the proposed mergers on USAir Group's financial measurements, as well as potential damage to the company's financial flexibility because of the probability of increased debt-service requirements.

Bally Manufacturing Corp said it expects a charge to earnings in the first quarter of this year of 17.3 mln dlrs as a result of its deal to buy back 2.6 mln of its common shares from real estate developer Donald Trump.     In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the Chicago-based hotel, casino, gambling and amusement concern also said the anticipated charge against first quarter earnings will not be deductible for federal income tax purposes.     Under a February 21 deal, Bally agreed to buy 2.6 mln of the 3.06 mln shares held by Trump at 24 dlrs a share, or 62.4 mln dlrs, while Trump agreed not to try to seek control of Bally.     The agreement also calls for Bally to pay Trump another 6.2 mln dlrs for certain agreements, claims and expenses related to his purchase of the Bally common stock, Bally said.     Trump agreed not to buy any more Bally stock or to try to seek control of the company for 10 years, it said.     Bear, Stearns and Co Inc signed a similar standstill agreement with Bally for three years, Bally said. But it can still deal in Bally stock as a broker, it said.

interest	WORLD BANK TO BRING BORROWING FORWARD THIS YEAR .  The World Bank intends to bring borrowing forward into the first half of 1987 because it expects global interest rates to rise by year end, World Bank vice president and treasurer Eugene Rotberg said.     He told a news conference that rates in the U.S., Japan, West Germany and Switzerland were near their lows. "The weight of opinion is (that in a year from now) there is a higher probability there will be one pct higher than one pct lower interest rates," he said.     The World Bank had not issued floating rate notes so far this year because of the expectation of higher interest rates.     The policy of the World Bank was to maintain liquidity at a level that gave the bank flexibility to decide when, where and how much to borrow, Rotberg said.     Cash in hand was now about 50 pct of the next three years' anticipated net requirement and comprised 25 pct of outstanding debt and 66 pct of its debt maturing within five years.     Although the World Bank had pioneered the swap market, it did not intend to launch new financial instruments just for the sake of innovation, Rotberg said.     Of a total of 74.5 billion dlrs debt outstanding, only some eight billion had been swapped into another currency.     Many recent innovations were either unfair to investors or unfair to borrowers. Until the World Bank was confident that this was not the case, it would not adopt new instruments.     The World Bank would raise 90 pct of the funds needed over the next year with methods used before, Rotberg said. However, for some 10 pct of new requirements the bank would try out new instruments such as bonds with warrants.     The World Bank had publicly offered 60 bonds in Germany since the first issue was launched in 1959, he said.  &#3;

AMC common shares opened at four dlrs this morning after the Renault-Chrysler announcement, up 3/8, while Chrysler shares lost 1/4 to 52-1/4.

"It's a reasonable deal for both sides," the analyst told Reuters.     "Chrysler gets the jeep franchise and the (new AMC) Bramalea, Ontario, plant and the (new Renault) Premier (mid-sized car) and AMC's sales will go up because buyers will have more confidence that the manufacturer will still be around to service the products," Glantz said.

It could take weeks before the extent of the compensation claims for passengers, crew and cargo was known and also before it was known how much, if any, of the ship could be salvaged, said David Larner of Lloyds.     The hull and machinery of the Herald of Free Enterprise were valued at 25 mln stg and were insured by Townsend Thoresen's parent company Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co Plc &lt;PORL.L>.     The vessel was in turn reinsured in the London market with Lloyds and various other companies, Larner said.     Passengers, crew and cargo were insured by the Standard Steamship Protection and Indemnity Association, one of several shipowners' mutual insurance funds worldwide. These were also underwritten by Lloyds and other companies.     Larner said claims from passengers could be expected to total at least five mln stg, given the number of deaths and the normal level of liability set by the Athens Convention of 1974 of between 30,000 stg and 50,000 in case of death.     Shipping sources said, however, that these claims could soar if a court found there was negligence or design faults involved.     Larner said estimates of compensation claims "were pure guess work" at this time. But if the ship could not be salvaged, the claims would total at least 30 mln stg.

"There's been rumors that they've taken a position in the company, said Wood Gundie analyst Edward Comeau.     Last year, Dart Group, owner of Auto Trak INc and Crown Books, competed against Kohlberg, Kravis to acquire Safeway Stores INc.     The company later reached an accord under which it would buy 20 pct of the company after Kohlberg Kravis completed its leveraged buyout of the company.     The company later sold its 20 pct stock for about 180 mln to 200 mln dlrs, according to analysts.      Dart Group Corp was not immediately available for comment.     Jerry Ballan, analyst with Conner Ballan division of Edward Viner and Co, said, "They &lt;Dart> has been rumored to be buying some other supermarkets as well, such as Stop and Shop."     "My guess is that Supermarkets General does not want to be bought out," said Ballan.     Analysts, however, said Supermarkets General is facing problems due to its Purity Supreme and Rickels operations, which might make it difficult to thwart a bid.     Supermarkets General is expected to report about 1.70 dlrs a share compared to a 1.73 dlrs a share reported for 1985 on a post stock split basis.     For the first quarter, Comeau predicts the company will earn 39 cts a share from 35 cts a share a year ago, and should earn about 2.05 dlrs for 1987.     "But that estimation could go to a 1.80 dlrs easily, due to Purity Supreme in New England," Comeau said.     He said competition among supermarkets is getting heated in that area and that the company has had difficulty with integrating Purity Supreme with its Pathmark store operations.     Rickels, a home center business, has faced problems due to the state of that industry, and has reported lower returns as an operating unit, according to analysts.     Analysts said that if Dart buys Supermarkets General it would probably divest the company's operations.     Analyst Comeau said "supermarkets general may seek a combination with another supermarket company." &#3;

gnp,money-supply	FED WATCHERS SEE U.S. ECONOMIC, INFLATION UPTURN .  This year will see a pickup in U.S. economic growth and inflation, the Shadow Open Market Committee said in its semi-annual policy statement.     The SOMC, a group of basically "monetarist" private economists, said that "economic growth will accelerate in 1987 in response to powerful stimulative actions by the Federal Reserve."     The group said the Fed's actions have been excessive. As a result, it said that "inflation and ultimately another recession now loom on the horizon."     The SOMC said that central bank policies that rely on progressively larger swings in monetary expansion will not lead to sustainable economic growth and stable prices.     The group made no specific nominal forecasts of economic or inflation growth in its policy statement. However, the Committee at its Sunday policy-making meeting said it was basically in accord with projections by Jerry Jordan, who is a member of the SOMC and economist at First Interestate Bancorp.     Jordan expects real GNP growth to be about one percentage point higher than in the past two years. He expects consumer prices to rise about 4-1/2 pct this year.     The SOMC said in recent months rapid money growth has been a principal cause of the devaluation. To avoid another costly inflation and disinflation, the SOMC urged the Fed to "abandon its inflationary policy and set the growth rate of the monetary base on the path toward sustained lower inflation."     The Fed in February said it would no longer target the narrow M-1 money supply because the link between M-1 and economic growth has been largely severed.  &#3;

The Dutch current account surplus fell 5.4 billion guilders last year to a provisional 12.1 billion guilders, the Finance Ministry said in a statement.     The surplus is expected to fall further in 1987, the statement said, but gave no details. Earlier today, the official planning agency CPB said it expected the surplus to fall to six billion guilders during 1987.     The visible goods surplus excluding energy fell by 5.6 billion guilders in 1986 to 11.4 billion due to declining terms of exchange, while more goods were imported as consumer spending and investment increased.     While the energy trade balance surplus rose by 5.4 billion guilders, 4.7 billion of this gain was caused by temporary improvements of terms of exchange and was aided by the delay between the fall in oil and gas prices.     The current account showed a 5.2 billion guilder deficit on invisibles, compared with a balance in 1985, the Finance Ministry said, noting the surplus on transport services was reduced substantially due to the lower dollar and oil price falls.     The fourth quarter current account showed a deficit, for the first time since 1980, of 700 mln guilders, it said.  REUTER &#3;

acq	TALKING POINT/CAESARS WORLD &lt;CAW> .  &lt;MTS Acquisition Corp's> 28-dlr-per-share offering price for Caesars World Inc is thought to be much too low and is likely to attract other suitors for the hotel/casino company, industry analysts said.     "I think someone else will probably come in, or they (MTS) will have to raise their bid," said Marvin Roffman, an analyst at Janney Montgomery Scott Inc.     MTS, a company formed by Martin Sosnoff, Caesars World's largest shareholder, today began a tender offer, valued at 725.2 mln dlrs, for all shares Sosnoff doesn't already own.     "I think the offer is too low by at least five points," said Roffman, who described Caesars World as the operator of "one of the finest casinos in the world."     Sosnoff, a New York investor, already owns 13.3 pct of Caesars World's 30.3 mln shares.     Following news of the tender offer Caesars World's shares were trading at 27-7/8, up 3-3/8.     A Caesars World spokesman said the company was declining comment on the Sosnoff move for the moment, but Caesars may issue a public statement after it has studied the offer.     Roffman said Caesars World has considerable growth potential and he is forecasting fiscal 1988 earnings of two dlrs per share.     Caesars World owns casino hotels in Nevada and honeymoon resorts in Pennsylvania's Pocono Mountains. It also controls Caesars New Jersey Inc &lt;CJN>, which owns an Atlantic City, N.J., casino hotel.     For its fiscal year ended July 31 Caesars World reported net income of 41 mln dlrs, or 1.36 dlrs per primary share.     The company reported second quarter net income of 12.6 mln dlrs, or 41 cts per share, compared with income of 7.5 mln dlrs, or 25 cts per share a year earlier.     Daniel Lee, an analyst at Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc, said that although Sosnoff's relatively low bid may attract other suitors willing to pay a higher price for Caesars, there is little likelihood that a competing bid would start a battle for the company.    &#3;

money-fx,dlr,trade,acq	USX &lt;X> CHAIRMAN CALLS FOR LOWER DOLLAR .  USX Corp chairman David Roderick called for a lower value for the U.S. dollar against other currencies to help speed a correction in the U.S. trade deficit, which last year reached 170 billion dlrs.     In remarks prepared for a speech before the Economic Club of Detroit, Roderick said, "There should be total resolve that the dollar versus other major currencies, as well as the currencies of other nations having a substantial trade surplus with us, must continue to decline so that the correction in our trade deficit starts on the road to recovery."     Roderick said the U.S. should be understanding of the "economic pain" our trading partners experience as a result of a falling dollar.     But, he added, "As painful as the correction may be to our trading partners, it is less painful than leaving the problem uncorrected because that would lead us into an inevitable, lengthy and steep world recession."     Roderick said between February 1985 and December 1986 the dollar fell by more than 40 pct in real terms against major industrial currencies and by 30 to 35 pct against a broader group of currencies of nearly all developing nations.     At the end of 1986, he said, the value of foreign assets in the U.S. exceeded the value of U.S. assets abroad by 240 billion dlrs, compared to five years ago when the U.S. had a surplus in assets of 141 billion. A company spokesman said the data were provided by economic consultants to USX.     The primary reason for the trade imbalance was the 70 pct rise of the dollar between 1980 and 1985, although other factors were involved, Roderick said. But it is wrong, he said, "to attribute the massive trade deficit to a fundmental deterioration of U.S. productivity or of American product quality."     These areas need to be improved but they are not the root cause of the trade gap problem, Roderick said. He urged American manufacturers to become more competitive so they can compete in global markets.     In the speech, the USX chairman also called for changes in securities laws to curb what he called abuses by corporate raiders and speculators.     Among his proposals, which he presented to the Senate Banking Committee in testimony last week, were a requirement that raiders give 24-hour notice for every one pct of stock they acquire in a company.     Roderick proposed that tender offers must be made for all cash to all stockholders on equal terms and that raiders be required to have financing in place before a tender is made.     Further, raiders should be required to make an all-cash tender offer once they acquire 10 pct of a target company's stock, he said. And payment of greenmail, or a preferential price by a target company to buy back a raider's stake, should be prohibited under the revised laws.     Roderick said changes were necessary to curb abuses but that he did not want laws that would hurt the financial markets or discourage "fair price to all" takeovers.  Reuter &#3;

Canadian Pacific Ltd said fourth quarter 1986 operating profit rose to 91.6 mln dlrs, or 30 cts a share, from 50.7 mln dlrs, or 20 cts a share, a year ago.     The statement confirmed released preliminary earnings figures the company released in February.     A 102.6 mln dlr gain on the sale of CP's Cominco Ltd interest helped raise final 1986 fourth quarter profit to 193.8 mln dlrs or 65 cts a share.     The company said a drop in 1986 full-year operating profit to 150.1 mln dlrs from a restated 252.7 mln dlrs in 1985 was due mainly to lower world oil prices.     The company said its CP Rail division reported 1986 net income of 119.4 mln dlrs, compared with 133.4 mln dlrs in 1985. It said grain traffic recovered from drought-affected levels of a year ago but was offset by weakness in other traffic areas and increased expenses.     It said the net loss from its Soo Line increased to 33.5 mln dlrs loss from 8.7 mln dlrs loss in 1985, mainly due to restructuring charges.     Canadian Pacific said favorable developments during the year included reduced bulk shipping losses as a result of a recovery in tanker markets and a turnaround in the forest products sector.

Keller said that she expects the company's 1987 earnings to rise to between 13.50-to-14 dlrs a share as compared to 12.32 dlrs a share earned last year.     She said Ford's already good market share is expected to remain favorable and earnings from overseas are expected to improve.     In addition, Keller said, the company is selling more of its expensive model cars, which are more profitable.     The non-automotive operations, including Ford Motor Credit, are also expected to post improved earnings this year.

The move will enable the exchange to concentrate on the cash settled contracts introduced last year.     "This allows the exchange and its members to concentrate our marketing on the pig and live cattle contracts," LMFE official Peter Freeman said. "These two have already shown their effectiveness for hedging, and the trade in both contracts is increasing," he added.     "Using the futures market allows better planning and forward price fixing that our industry needs," chairman Pat Elmer said.     Some 131 pig contracts were settled against the Meat and Livestock Commission's Average All Pigs Price in February, which represents hedging for over 13,000 pigs, more than twice the number cash-settled in January, the LMFE said.     Cash settlement on the new cattle and pig contracts was introduced last June in the expectation that the appeal of the futures market to farmers, abattoirs and users of meat would increase because of the absence of a delivery requirement.

Two new eurosterling bonds were launched today, making a total of 10 new deals in the sector so far this month, as borrowers rush to cash in on a bull sterling market fueled by the strength of the pound and pre-budget euphoria.     The Bank of England finally gave way to a 1/2 point cut in banks' base lending rates earlier today, but dealers said this had been largely discounted and was not likely to detract from the current popularity of sterling-denominated investments.     "Sterling, in any shape or form, is flavor of the month and we're set to see many more eurosterling deals," one dealer said.     Today's new eurosterling bonds were a 10-year, 100 mln stg deal for Sweden at 9-1/2 pct and priced at 101-1/4 pct, lead by Baring Brothers and Co Ltd and a 14 year 60 mln stg convertible deal for Storehouse Plc launched by SBCI International Ltd. "We thought we saw a proverbial flood of new deals with the 14 we had last month but it seems March will beat February hands down with 10 already," one eurosterling specialist said.     "Optically, psychologically, these single figures are much more attractive for the borrower. Eurosterling looks like a cheap and attractive way to raise your money," he added.     This accounts for the wide variety of borrowers who have tapped the sector recently, ranging from sovereigns such as the Kingdom of Sweden today, continental banks including Commerzbank and Deutsche Bank and British corporations.     Another U.K. Merchant bank analyst noted that the current vogue for eurosterling enabled several corporate borrowers last month to offer paper priced below comparative gilt yields.     A Storehouse official confirmed that the issue was aimed at Swiss and German investors who were showing good interest.     This is the first entry into the long term international capital markets by Storehouse, British designer Terence Conran's retail conglomerate which incorporates U.K. Chain stores Mothercare, British Home Stores and Habitat.     "We have been considering the move for quite some time now and the current strength of the eurosterling sector provided the perfect opportunity and spur for us to finally tap the market," Lance Moir, corporate treasurer at Storehouse Plc told Reuters.  &#3;

USAir said a Manufacturers Hanover affiliate is currently agent for its 400 mln dlrs revelving credit facility, which would be replaced by the proposed two billion dlr financing.     USAir put its total cost of completing the tender offer at 1.7 billion dlrs. Its Pacific Southwest takeover, which has received federal approval and is due to come up for shareholder approval later this month, is for 17 dlrs a share, or 400 mln dlrs total.

The Agriculture Department will have to release an estimated 1.6 billion dlrs worth of in-kind certificates, or certs, to corn farmers this fall if USDA decides to maintain an equal split of total 1986 feedgrain deficiency payments in cash and certs, USDA officials said.     Final 1986 crop deficiency payments will be available to feed grain producers in October. Wheat deficiency payments for the 1986 crop, now complete, were made in a 50/50 cash-certificate split, and USDA officials have indicated they want to do the same for feedgrains.     Over 3.2 billion dlrs of an estimated 6.0 billion in corn deficiency payments have already been announced, with 1.42 billion dlrs (43 pct) set in certificates. The final payment must be 1.6 billion dlrs in certs (57 pct) for a 50/50 split.     However, the release this month of almost 600 mln dlrs of deficiency payments was equally divided in cash and certs, doing nothing to bring up the percentage of certs.     Some USDA analysts said the payments reflected hesitation from the Office of Managament and Budget to allow another huge release of certs onto the market.     Bills are pending in Congress to move up the final feedgrain deficiency payment to "as soon as five months after harvest as possible," rather than the current year lag time.     Neither Rep.

Brazilian marines were today working on the unloading of ships at the local port as a national strike by 40,000 seamen entered its 10th day without signs of an agreement.     The halt, the first national strike by seamen in 25 years, started on February 27, and union leaders said they would not return to work unless they received a 275 pct pay rise.     Shipowners have offered a 100 pct raise, which the seamen rejected.     "Television reported that the port was operating at full speed, but that's not true," a striking seaman told Reuters.     "The marines are doing their best, but they don't have the manpower nor the experience to control the situation in such a quick period," he said.

grain,wheat,corn	USDA RAISES SOVIET GRAIN IMPORT ESTIMATE .  The U.S. Agriculture Department increased its estimate of Soviet 1986/87 grain imports to 26 mln tonnes from last month's projection of 23 mln tonnes.     In its monthly USSR Grain Situation and Outlook, USDA said the increase reflected the return of the Soviet Union to the U.S. corn market and continued purchases of both wheat and coarse grain from other major suppliers.     USSR wheat imports were projected at 15 mln tonnes, up one mln from last month's estimate and 700,000 tonnes below the preliminary 1985/86 figure.     Soviet grain for feed use was estimated at a record 129 mln tonnes. Record or near-record livestock inventories, along with a dry fall which likely reduced late season pasturage, and a cold winter have increased feed demand, USDA said.     USSR meat and egg production in January rose only slightly from the previous January's level, while milk production increased by nearly six pct.     Unusually cold weather in January and smaller increases in roughage supplies during 1986 than in 1985 kept livestock production from expanding as much as it did a year earlier, USDA said.

crude	ECUADOR QUAKE TO CUT OIL REVENUES 800 MLN DLRS .  up to 300 people were feared dead and more than 15,000 people left homeless by thursday's earthquake, which will cost Ecuador close to 800 mln dlrs in lost petroleum revenues, authorities said.     They estimated the cost of repairing a damaged oil pipeline at 150 mln dlrs.     "the magnitude of the damages caused by the earthquake is gigantic," president leon febres cordero said after inspecting the damages in napo, the hardest-hit jungle province, 100 miles from here.     The quake damaged 40 km of an oil pipeline, forcing this opec nation to suspend crude exports for four months, president febres cordero said in a statement issued today by the presidential press office.     The country would lose an estimated 800 mln dlrs in crude exports until the pipeline was repaired, the president said. It would cost 150 mln dlrs to repair the pipelline which carries oil from jungle oil fields over the andes to Balao, a pacific ocean port.     Crude traditionally accounts for up to two-thirds of ecuador's exports.     the quake triggered landslides, swelling the aguarico river which burst it banks carrying away homes and huts in napo province, health minister jorge brancho told reuters.     "we fear that up to 300 people died in napo though there is no way of now knowing the exact figure because many people have disappeared," he said.     Other estimates ranged as high as 500 dead.     So far 20 corpses have been recovered, bracho said.     Information Minister Marco Lara told reporters: "the number of dead and injured is not known ... because we do not know how many people lived in the homes hit by the landslides."     Bracho said at least 15,000 were left homeless in the cayambe district.  Reuter &#3;

French maize producers will ask the EC Commission to grant permanent maize export rebates following the recent EC/U.S. Accord guaranteeing the U.S. An annual export quota of two mln tonnes of maize for Spain over four years, the French maize producers association, AGPM, said.     The Commission has already decided to accord rebates for the export of 500,000 tonnes of French maize, of which rebates for around 100,000 tonnes have been granted.     The request will be made when export certificates have been granted for all the 500,000 tonnes, the AGPM said.     The association said that the request would cover exports to all destinations, adding that the Soviet Union, which has important maize needs, is currently excluded from the list of destination countries for the 500,000 tonnes of French maize.

The dollar will decline over the next two to three years, but this is unlikely to result in a complete reduction of the U.S. current account deficit, said Anthony Solomon, chairman of S.G. Warburg (USA) Inc and former president of the Federal Reserve Bank of New York.     In a presentation to the Japan Society, Solomon said without elaboration that he expects a "significant decline in the dollar," within the next three years.     "The dollar will fall more, but the current account deficit will stop being reduced when it reaches its structural core," he said.     Solomon described the structural core as about one-half of the current 150 billion dlr annual deficit. He cited several factors which will prevent an elimination of the deficit.     For one thing, it is unlikely that there will be any new investment in those manufacturing industries that shrank when the dollar was at uncompetitive levels, he said.     In addition, he said that the U.S. has an increased propensity to import in order to satisify consumer tastes.     Solomon forecast inflation at 4.5 pct by year-end, but said it could be kept below five pct in the medium-term if oil prices are stable and commodity values remain low.  Reuter &#3;

gnp	WORLD BANK REPORT CRITICISES PERU ECONOMIC PLAN .  a confidential world bank report on the peruvian economy said the government's strategy does not offer good prospects for medium and long-term growth and is likely to quickly lead to inflation.     The report, published today by an economic monthly, the peru report, said the success of president alan garcia's government in stimulating output last year to achieve eight pct gross domestic product growth "represents gains in the short term at the expense of the long."     Government officials had no immediate comment on the report, which advised a reduction in the overall size of the public investment programme and greater emphasis on the preservation of peru's export potential.     The report said that although the government had succeeded in cutting inflation 50 pct a year in the first half of 1985 to under 70 pct, its stabilisation and reactivation programme was encountering increasing difficulties.     "an early renewal of inflationary pressures, linked to monetary expansion, exchange rate devaluation and an easing of price controls, appears not improbable," it added.  &#3;
gnp	MINISTERS FEEL EC FORECASTS TOO PESSIMISTIC .  European Community finance ministers discussed the economic outlook for the 12-nation bloc and many said a recent gloomy forecast by the EC Commission was too pessimistic.     The Commission, the EC's executive authority, two weeks ago cut its forecast for economic growth in the Community to 2.3 per cent for this year from 2.8 per cent predicted last autumn.     It said economic prospects had been less promising over the past few months because of a sharp fall in the value of the dollar and a slowing of world trade -- factors which would restrain Community exports.     But diplomats said several member states, led by West Germany, Britain and France, felt the forecast was too gloomy, especially since it was drafted before a recent agreement between the leading Western economic powers to stabilise currencies around current levels.     "Many delegations feel the (Commission's) report is rather too pessimistic," said Belgian Finance Minister Mark Eyskens, who chaired the meeting.     The Commission, which slashed its growth forecast for West Germany to two per cent from 3.2 per cent, has made clear it feels Bonn has room to introduce additional measures to stimulate its economy that would benefit the rest of Europe.     But two top German officials, State Secretaries Otto Schlecht and Hans Tietmeyer, told reporters Bonn saw no need at the moment for action to bolster the EC's biggest economy.     The diplomats said they were backed by Britain and France, while Italy, Greece and Denmark supported the Commission's view that Bonn should bring in new measures to aid EC growth. &#3;

"No action should be ruled out--import fees or quotas, floor prices, tax incentives or other alternatives--while a national dialogue on the issue continues," DiBona said at a  paper institute conference in New York today.     DiBona said there is no unanimity within the industry on how to stimulate energy production but there is consensus on removing several government policies that hinder investments in new prospects.     DiBona said the windfall profit tax should be abolished immediately and current proposals for increased environmental regulations on acid rain and waste disposal should be not adopted. He also suggested that the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge in Alaska should be opened up for leasing to oil companies, DiBona said.     "This is a battle the industry cannot afford to lose if the nation is to continue to benefit from Alaskan oil," DiBona said. Since 1986 U.S. oil production has fallen while consumption rose and that has raised dependence on imported oil, particularly from OPEC, DiBona said.      Reuter &#3;

earn	GENERAL CINEMA &lt;GCN> POOR SEASON LOWERS NET .  General Cinema Corp said lower attendence at its theatres against last year's record Christmas season lowered its first fiscal quarter operating earnings nine pct to 15.9 mln dlrs.     "While we are not off to as good a start in fiscal 1987 as we would like, business has picked up in the last few weeks," chairman Richard Smith said.     He said that the company expected net pricing to be higher and unit volume to improve in the remaining quarters of the fiscal year.     The company added that operating earnings in its theatre unit will be higher in fiscal 1987 if the important summer season film releases perform well.     In addition, its other key business, General Cinema Beverages, is expected to achieve record operating results for the full year, Smith said.     The company's superstar video business which rents video cassettes in supermarkets continues to operate at an expected loss, the company added.     General Cinema said the financing costs associated with its purchase of 3.5 mln Carter Hawley Hale Stores Inc &lt;CHH> shares for 177.9 mln dlrs, and its 89.7 mln sterling investment in &lt;Cadbury Schweppes PLC>, lowered first quarter net.

Warrington said it plans to concentrate on its Canstar Sports Group Inc skate and athletic footwear division, the largest ice skate manufacturer and distributor in the Western world.     Warrington said it decided to rationalize the balance of its ski businesses, which is expected to result in a divestment loss which could outweigh the net gains on the sales of its shoe and ski boot divisions.

grain	CBT DISCUSSES MAJOR CHANGES FOR RENOVATION .  Chicago Board of Trade (CBT) agricultural and financial futures markets could be in for a period of major upheaval later this year if the exchange goes ahead with planned renovation.     A CBT spokesman told Reuters the exchange was looking at a number of options to identify the most cost effective and efficient way to proceed, including one which would involve moving the entire grains floor out of the building and into the nearby MidAmerica Commodity Exchange.     "One of (CBT Chairman) Karsten Mahlmann's agenda items has been to proceed with renovation in the financial futures room," the spokesman said.     Another CBT official, executive vice president George Sladoje, said the issue would be discussed this Friday at a special meeting on the exchange floor.     A number of presentations have been made with regard to renovating the financial futures room, Sladoje said. "We've looked at five or six different alternatives, involving such things as flip-flopping the trading rooms," he added.     It is conceivable that under a couple of these plans, we might use the MidAmerica Exchange temporarily for some CBT markets, Sladoje said.     "If we move out of one floor entirely, then the construction period will be about a year," he said, adding that the issue was likely to go to a membership vote first and then be on the drawing board for eight months to a year.     The CBT spokesman stressed that discussions were very preliminary at this stage and nothing was likely to begin until this summer at the earliest.     In order to renovate the crowded financial futures pits, exchange officials have discussed providing them a temporary home next door in the present grains-dominated area.     This could involve moving CBT markets in U.S. Treasury Bond futures, Treasury Notes, Muni-bonds, and options on T-Bonds and T-Notes through an adjoining corridor, while utilizing the MidAmerica floor for such CBT futures contracts as corn, wheat, soybeans, soybean products and agricultural options.     Any such moves could meet with opposition among some CBT members.     One senior floor trader said the financial futures room badly needs renovating.     "There is talk the grains floor will shift to the MidAm and the financials will move to the grains area," he said.     The CBT spokesman said another option being discussed was to renovate the financial floor in quadrants, one quarter at a time. "The first step, after deciding the most effective way to proceed, would be to get architectural and engineering drawings," he said.     He added that it was difficult at present to determine an exact time frame for any possible moves. "This is a major undertaking and a process that would spread out over next year," he said.     Floor traders at the MidAmerica Commodity Exchange, which merged with the CBT about a year ago, said they were preparing to vacate their floor at the end of this month.     Space has recently been cleared for them at the CBT by moving its Major Market Index pit into the area once reserved for lightly-traded CBT gold and silver futures, which now share their trading area.     The MidAm specializes in mini-contracts in grains, livestock, metals, financials and foreign currencies as well as some options contracts.     "Rumor has it that the CBT grains are coming over here because the bonds are too crowded," one MidAm trader said.     Another source at the MidAm said this change could take place by July or August.

A group of investment firms led by Far Hills, N.J., investor Natalie Koether said it is seeking information about the shareholders of Prime Medical Services Inc, over which it has said it is seeking control.     In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, the group, which includes Shamrock Associates, included a March 6 letter to Prime which asks for a complete list of all shareholders and their addresses.     The group said it wants the information so it can contact shareholders on issues, including election of an opposition slate of directors to the board and other proxy contests.     The Koether group's letter gives the company five days to respond to its request. If there is no response from Prime Medical, the group said it would consider the demand refused and would take "other proper steps" to get the information.     The group said it already holds 1,483,886 Prime Medical shares, or 17.5 pct of the total. It said it has taken legal action to try to force the company to set an annual meeting and require all directors to stand for election.

acq	CHRYSLER &lt;C> AMC BUYOUT VALUED AT 1.55 BILLION .  Chrysler Corp's proposed acquisition of American Motors Corp is valued at about 1.55 billion dlrs, including the cost of acquisition and the 767 mln dlrs in American Motor' debt that Chrysler will assume, analysts said.     They said Chrysler's cost of acquisition was valued at  782 mln dlrs, paid in cash, notes and Chrysler shares.     The analysts told Reuters that at a New York briefing Chrysler treasurer Fred Zuckerman outlined his company's agreement with Renault to assume AMC's debt as well as 332 mln dlrs in unfunded pension liabilities, though the latter is not included valuing the transaction.     Analysts were generally positive on Chrysler's proposed purchase of its much-smaller rival, but said they expected the transaction would carry with it a short-term dilution in Chrysler's earnings.     A Chrysler financial source, speaking anonymously, told Reuters that the proposed purchase price was smaller than it would have been had a deal been struck last year because the impact of the new U.S. tax law removes Chrysler's ability to assume AMC's large reserve of tax-loss carryforwards accumulated from its losses since 1980.     "There were very serious discussions last fall but we didn't pull it off," the source said in a reference to the assassination in November of former Renault chairman Georges Besse.     "It's too bad because the tax benefits fell on the floor. And Renault could have gotten a much better price if we'd done it before the end of last year."     In addition to AMC's debt and its pension liabilities, the source said Chrysler would also assume any liability from lawsuits over the safety of Jeeps, which he called "an overhang to the company."     Analysts quoted Chrysler officials as having told them that the deal includes payment to Renault of 200 mln dlrs principal in the form of a 10-year note at eight pct interest, 35 mln dlrs cash for Renault's equity in AMC's finance subsidiary, 25 mln dlrs in cash for "transaction fees" in connection with the acquisition and 522 mln dlrs worth of Chrysler stock to be paid AMC shareholders.     "The big number is the 767 mln dlrs in debt assumption," analyst Jack Kirnan of Kidder Peabody and Co told Reuters.      Moody's Investors Service Inc said it may downgrade 12 billion dlrs of Chrysler Corp and unit debt due to the deal.      But the Chrysler source said that in assuming AMC's liabilities, his company will refinance at a lower rate any AMC debt that is being carried at "non-market" rates.     He said there were difficulties in negotiating with the previous Renault management on the acquisition because they were committed to the group's business plan of which AMC was an integral part.     "The new management didn't have that problem - AMC wasn't their baby," he said.  Reuter &#3;

gnp,cpi,money-fx	WORLD BANK REPORT CRITICISES PERU ECONOMIC PLAN .  A confidential World Bank report on the Peruvian economy has said the government's strategy does not offer good prospects for medium and long-term growth and is likely to lead to an early renewal of inflationary pressure.     The report, published today by the economic monthly, The Peru Report, said the success of president Alan Garcia's government in stimulating output last year to achieve a growth in gross domestic product of over eight pct "represents gains in the short term at the expense of the long."     Government officials had no immediate comment on the report, which advised a reduction in the overall size of the public investment program and greater emphasis on the preservation of Peru's export potential.     The report said that although the government had succeeded in cutting inflation from 250 pct a year in the first half of 1985 to under 70 pct, its stabilisation and reactivation program was encountering rising difficulties.     "An early renewal of inflationary pressures, linked to monetary expansion, exchange rate devaluation and an easing of price controls, appears not improbable," it added.     The world bank report said the government's policies had reduced inflation and short-term increases in consumption at the apparent cost of price distortions, overvaluation of the currency, balance of payments disequilibrium, reserve losses, and sharply diminished creditworthiness.     It said unless the government took action quickly to fix a competitive exchange rate and control the public sector deficit, "the higher the probability will be that the government will eventually have to resort to drastic curtailment of domestic demand and either sharp devaluation or still further controls on imports in order to stem inflation and support the balance of payments."     It said the bank would place more emphasis on the preservation of peru's export potential, external links and overall economic efficiency.     The government's incentive policies towards the mining and petroleum sectors, among its main traditional exports, suggested that it did not accord high priority to their economic viability, it added.

Financier Carl Lindner, who holds a 16.2 pct stake in Taft Broadcasting Co, told the Securities and Exchange Commission he has discussed with the company the possibility of seeking control of it.     Lindner, the Cincinnati, Ohio, investor who controls American Financial Corp, said his talks with some of Taft's managers and directors have been aimed at "achieving an increased ownership position" in the company.     Lindner said his increase in ownership would be made either by making an offer to acquire control of Taft or taking part in a group to acquire the company.     Lindner, who holds his Taft stake through American Financial and its subsidiaries, said he is also considering buying more Taft stock on the open market or in private deals.     He did not say whether the talks with Taft officials led to any agreements or understandings.     But Lindner said he intends to review his investment in Taft and may be involved in further talks or take other steps regarding the future control and direction of Taft.     Lindner's investor group recently raised its Taft stake to 1,489,298 shares, or 16.2 pct from 1,439,498 shares, or 15.6 pct, after buying 49,800 shares for a total of 5.8 mln dlrs.     Although he recently received clearance from the Federal Trade Commission to raise his stake in the company to 24.9 pct, Lindner in previous SEC filings has always stressed that his interest in Taft was for investment only and not was not seeking to control the company.

money-fx,dlr,yen	U.S. INTERVENED TO AID DLR IN JANUARY, FED SAYS .  U.S. authorities intervened in the foreign exchange market to support the dollar on one occasion during the period between the start of November 1986 and the end of January, the Federal Reserve Bank of New York said in a report.     The Fed's quarterly review of foreign exchange operations said that the U.S. bought 50 mln dlrs through the sale of yen on January 28. This operation was coordinated with the Japanese monetary authorities and was funded equally by the Fed and the U.S. Treasury.     The Fed's intervention was on the morning after president Reagan's State of the Union message and was "in a manner consistent with the joint statement" made by U.S. Treasury secretary James Baker and Japanese finance minister Kiichi Miyazawa after their January 21 consultations.     At that meeting, the two reaffirmed their willingness to cooperate on exchange rate issues.     The Fed's report did not say at what level the intervention occurred. But on January 28, the dollar closed at 151.50/60 yen after dipping as low as 150.40 yen earlier in the session. It had closed at 151.05/15 yen the previous day.     The dollar had plumbed a post-World War II low of 149.98 yen on January 19 and reached a seven-year low of 1.7675 marks on January 28. It ended that day at 1.7820/30 marks.     The Fed noted that, after trading steadily throughout November and the first half of December, the dollar moved sharply lower until the end of January.     It closed the three-month review period down more than 11 pct against the mark and most other Continental currencies and seven pct lower against the yen and sterling. It had fallen four pct against the Canadian dollar.     During the final days of January, pressure on the dollar subsided. Reports of the U.S.-Japanese intervention operation and talk of an upcoming meeting of the major industrial countries encouraged expectations for broader cooperation on exchange rate and economic policy matters, the Fed said.     Moreover, doubts had developed about the course of U.S. interest rates. The dollar's swift fall had raised questions about whether the Fed would let short-term rates ease.     Thus the dollar firmed to close the period at 1.8320 marks and 153.70 yen. According to the Fed's trade-weighted index, it had declined nine pct since the beginning of the period.     The dollar had risen as high as 2.08 marks and 165 yen in early November.     The Fed last intervened in the foreign exchange market on November 7, 1985 when it bought a total of 102.2 mln dlrs worth of marks and yen.     The Fed's action followed the September 1985 Plaza agreement between the five major industrial nations under which they agreed to promote an orderly decline of the dollar.  Reuter &#3;

grain,corn,wheat	USSR SEEN LIKELY TO HONOR CORN COMMITMENT .  The Soviet Union will likely honor its commitment with the United States to buy a minimum of four mln tonnes of corn this year, an Agriculture Department official said.     "They have always honoured the agreement, and there's no reason now to think they won't this year," he told Reuters.     "They have an aggressive buying campaign from the European Community, from Canada, from the U.S. They're active buyers from all sources at this point," the official said in explaining why the Department raised its Soviet grain imports estimate today by three mln tonnes to 26 mln tonnes.     This is a dramatic shift from just a few months ago when analysts were saying the USSR might not buy any U.S. corn for the first time in 15 years.     A drawdown of corn supplies in China and Argentina, concern over Soviet winter crops, and increasing competition for U.S. corn were all cited as possible factors in creating Moscow's recent interest.     Lower corn production prospects in some major supplying countries have stirred activity from big buyers such as Japan, and the Soviets are also closely watching the situation, the official said.     "The Soviets will try to out-capitalize the capitalists" and buy corn before prices get too high, the official said. "As soon as they need corn, they'll buy it," he added.     USDA has confirmed one mln tonnes of corn sold to the Soviet Union, but both U.S. and Soviet analysts have said the purchases stand at 1.5 mln tonnes.     The USDA official would not speculate on when the Soviets would enter the U.S. market again.     "There has definitely been an evolving mind set -- from the situation of slow grain buying a couple months ago to one of frenetic buying now," the official said.     However, the situation in wheat is "a different story," he said. Greater world supplies of wheat, heavier Soviet purchase commitments and less competitive U.S. wheat prices make Soviet purchases of U.S. wheat less likely, he said.     Speculation has continued for several days that the U.S. is considering making an export bonus wheat subsidy offer to the Soviets, but U.S. officials have provided no confirmation.   Reuter &#3;
crude	PICKENS SEES CONTINUED SLUMP IN WORKING RIGS .  T. Boone Pickens, the Texas oilman and financier, said he believes the heady days the oil service industry had in the early 1980s, when over 4,500 oil rigs were once reported operating, will not return in his lifetime.      Pickens told Reuters he expects the rig count to drop to below 600 before recovering. He added that oil prices will eventually rise to 35 dlrs, then to 50 dlrs after 1990.      Currently, some 700 oil rigs are operating in the U.S., down sharply after oil prices slipped from 30 dlrs in late 1985 to around 10 dlrs in 1986. Prices are now around 18 dlrs. The highest number of working rigs was 4,500 in December 1981.      "The rigs won't go back to work until the price of oil gets above 30 dlrs," he said, adding that while he expects to see 50 dlr a barrel oil, he does not expect to see 2,000 rigs operating in his lifetime. Pickens is 58.      Pickens, who is currently touring the country promoting his autobiography "Boone," said he does not believe the U.S. should impose an oil import fee in order to stimulate the domestic oil industry.

rubber	RUBBER LEAF DISEASE SEEN AFFECTING SUPPLY/PRICES .  The leaf disease corenes pora, which has affected some rubber trees in Sri Lanka and Indonesia, is likely to force a cut in supply and push up depressed prices, a Malaysian rubber disease researcher said.     Trees with leaves hit by the fungus disease cannot be saved and must be felled, Chee Kheng Hoy, Head of the Crop Protection and Microbiology Division in the Rubber Research Institute of Malaysia (RRIM), told Reuters.     He was commenting on a Reuter report which said corenes pora had hit seven pct of Sri Lanka's plantations and may cause output to drop below its 1987 target of 143,000 tonnes.     The report said the Sri Lankan Rubber Research Institute may ask estates to remove trees seriously affected by the disease and added that most estates affected belong to the State Plantations Corp and Janatha Estates Development Board.     Chee said corenes pora is an old disease which only affects certain rubber clones in Sri Lanka and Indonesia and that further use of such clones must be discontinued.     Clones not resistant to the disease are the Rubber Research Institute of Sri Lanka clone 103, Indonesia's PPN 2058, 2444, 2447 and PR 265 and Malaysia's RRIM 725, he said.     Chee said corenes pora affected trees from the RRIM 725 clone planted in Malaysia several years ago but had been curbed after use of such clones were discontinued.     Fungicide may be used to curb the disease, which also affects leaves of 30 other species of plants, but experience has proven that it is uneconomical and expensive, he added.     "The disease is extremely difficult to control. If it is not curbed in the two affected countries their rubber output may drop and prices can rise," he said.     He added that the RRIM was aware of the disease outbreak in Sri Lanka and was monitoring the situation.  REUTER &#3;
ship	SEARCH FOR BRITISH FERRY'S TOXIC CARGO CONTINUES .  The search continued for a cargo of poisonous chemical substances loaded on the Herald of Free Enterprise Ferry which capsized in Zeebrugge harbour Friday.     A total of 72 drums of various toxic materials which were loaded on trucks in the ship's hold have been recovered, but Belgian authorities warned it was essential to recover a further 61 containers of a cyanide-based solution.     A net has been thrown over the gaping loading doors at the front of the ship to prevent any more drums floating out.     Salvage workers have moved cranes into place alongside the wreck of the 7,951 ton roll-on, roll-off ferry which now lies partly submerged on a sandbank outside the harbour.     The ferry's owner is &lt;European Ferries Plc>, majority owned by Peninsular and Oriental Steam Navigation Co Plc &lt;PORL.L>.     The operation to right the vessel began yesterday after divers abandoned their search for more bodies. Experts said it could take months to refloat the ship and free the 80 bodies estimated to be trapped amid debris.     "The problem is that in these waters you can normally expect one working day out of four," said Daan Kaakebeen of Dutch Salvage experts Smit Tak International of Rotterdam. He estimated the job itself would require 35 working days.     Using reinforced cables, salvage experts intend to raise the ship and set it down into a trench dug alongside.     Salvage work could pinpoint the exact cause of the loss of the ferry, one of three sister vessels plying cross-Channel routes from England to continental Europe.     Suspicion at present is focused on the ferry's main vehicle loading doors, set close to water level.     In London, Transport Secretary John Moore told parliament yesterday that the ship keeled over after water gushed in through the bow doors. He said a major government inquiry into the disaster will be held, all similar ferries sailing from Britain will be inspected and owners will be asked to fit lights to give warning if bow doors are not properly closed.     Experts carrying out tank and computer tests to determine how the accident occurred will focus attention on the ship's doors, its ballast system and crew procedures, he added.     Two other investigations into the disaster have also begun, one Belgian and one by the ferry's owners.  REUTER &#3;
trade	SOVIET ECONOMIST SEES FEW 1987 GAINS IN U.S. TRADE .  There is little chance Soviet exports to the United States will rise in 1987, but Moscow's current trade reforms should result in more trade in manufactured goods in future, a Soviet economist said.     Sergey Frolov, chief economist at Amtorg Trading Corp, an agent for Soviet trade organisations and industries, told a U.S.-USSR business meeting the Soviet Union produces few items that western nations want.     But reforms, including upgrading the quality of goods and allowing joint ventures with foreign firms, will encourage modest export gains in future.     Frolov said the Soviet Union exported 500 mln dlrs worth of goods to the United States in 1986 and imported 1.5 billion dlrs worth. He gave no trade forecast for 1987.     But he said that even if all obstacles were removed, total trade between the two countries would remain between two and three billion dlrs a year.     "The post-detente embargoes have taught the USSR to limit its trading with the U.S.," he said.  REUTER &#3;

grain,wheat,rice	SICHUAN BRACED TO FIGHT DROUGHT .  The Sichuan government has ordered that any work or meeting which interferes with the fight against drought must be cancelled or postponed to save time, energy and manpower, the People's Daily domestic edition said.     Sichuan is one of six provinces threatened by drought.     Wen Wei Po, a Hong Kong daily, said the drought, the worst for more than 20 years, is affecting nearly two mln hectares in 100 counties in Sichuan, the country's biggest agricultural producer.     Sichuan has experienced temperatures three degrees Centigrade higher than normal and rainfall up to 70 pct less than normal since early February, affecting wheat, oil-bearing crops, rice planting and dryland cash crops, it said.     The paper said 43,000 hectares in Meixian county in Guangdong are seriously short of water.     The People's Daily said Henan, Shaanxi, Gansu and Hebei are also suffering from drought.     Henan's grain output fell by 2.5 mln tonnes last year from the 1985 level because of drought which has been affecting the province since May.  REUTER &#3;
trade	ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - JAPAN PUSHES ITS CHIPMAKERS .  Japanese microchip makers are being strong-armed into compliance with a U.S.-Japan pact on semiconductors halting predatory pricing and opening Japan's market to foreign chips, industry analysts said.     But doubts remain over whether the Ministry of International Trade and Industry (MITI), which is pressuring the firms, can successfully battle market forces and whether the U.S. Industry is geared up to take advantage of any breathing space, they said.     U.S. Threats to scrap the agreement signed last September have pushed MITI to try harder to get recalcitrant Japanese chipmakers to abide by the pact, the analysts said.     "MITI has been moving hot and heavy throughout the industry to get things done," said Bache Securities (Japan) associate vice president Peter Wolffe.     Last month, MITI told chipmakers to cut production for the January to March period by 10 pct to help dry up inexpensive chips that have escaped from Japan to grey markets not subject to the pact's price controls.     The ministry also asked electronics firms to provide distributors with certificates designating them as authorised exporters, in an effort to close loopholes through which grey marketeers sneak chips out of Japan, market analysts said.     U.S. Trade negotiators here last week said the pact was in jeopardy because of continued dumping in non-American markets and little sign of increased foreign sales in Japan.     But major Japanese firms appear to have agreed to the production cuts, several analysts said. Last week, NEC Corp said it would cut production in line with MITI's request.     "NEC has been the most aggressive in resisting MITI's demands," said David Keller, analyst at James Capel and Co. "Once NEC cuts production, it means they all have."     Still, pressures remain to keep production high. Japanese firms need high output to cut unit prices for U.S. Sales that the Commerce Department assigns them under the pact.     "The best way to lower cost is to produce more," said Salomon Brothers Asia Ltd analyst Carole Ryavec.     Preparations for a possible upturn in demand could also spur higher production next quarter, Merrill Lynch analyst Matt Aizawa said.     Grey marketeers may also be able to outfox any new restrictions, some industry officials said.     "It's like tax avoidance schemes," said Steve Donovan, head of MMI Japan K.K. "As soon as you close one route, another opens."     MITI's pressure has annoyed some makers, who had earlier shrugged off MITI guidance.     "It's getting to be like communism," said one.     But analysts said output cuts could help by making it easier to increase prices as planned on April 1 and forcing firms to stop extending market share by selling at a loss.     "They're going to have to start running their businesses like businesses," Bache's Wolffe said.     MITI has also been conducting a highly public campaign urging chip users to buy foreign-made chips, but U.S. Industry officials said response has been mixed at best.     "There has been some change, but it's not across the board," said one U.S. Spokesman. "The companies have a varying degree of urgency."     The ultimate impact of all these efforts by MITI on the troubled U.S. Industry remains in doubt, analysts added.     Pressure to cut production of 256 kilobit DRAM (dynamic random access memory) chips could merely speed the transition to one megabit chips, where Japan now leads, analysts said.     Whether U.S. Firms are able to stage a comeback in memory chips, or interested in doing so, also remains unclear, they said.     Analysts are watching with interest the fate of a new U.S. Consortium which hopes to challenge Japan by developing the most advanced technology for microchip manufacturing.     Even in the thorny area of access, much depends on U.S. Commitment as well as on Japanese openness, some said.     "The SIA (U.S. Semiconductor Industry Association) doesn't even have an office here," a source close to the industry said. "You could question just how committed they are."     In addition, some industry analysts question the effectiveness of a bilateral agreement that leaves out third country chipmakers such as those in South Korea.     "(South) Korea's gaining market share," said one analyst. "They're the real winners from the agreement."  REUTER &#3;
interest	SUMITA SAYS LITTLE ROOM FOR BANK TO EASE POLICY .  Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said there is little room left for the central bank to further ease its credit policy as interest rates levels are now approaching their lower limit.     "The government should instead seek ways of making the best use of its fiscal policy," he told a press conference.     His remarks were concerned with a comprehensive economic stimulative package the government plans to adopt in the coming days.     At the recent talks among the six major industrialised nations in Paris, Japan promised to work out a comprehensive economic package to boost domestic demand, which in turn would help increase its imports and reduce its trade surplus.     Sumita also said the economy will show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year if the yen remains stable.     He said there is caution in the foreign exchange market against a further rise of the yen and mark and this explains the recent stability in the currency markets. Conflicting economic indicators from the U.S. Have also been dampening market activity, he added.  REUTER &#3;

The official Saudi Press Agency quoted him as saying his talks at Riyadh with Nazir had been constructive and good.     Aqazadeh said Organisation of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) members were agreed on holding production stable and he reiterated the importance of maintaining oil prices.     OPEC members agreed in December to limit production to 15.8 mln barrels per day for the first half of this year and on a benchmark price of 18 dlrs a barrel from February 1.     Aqazadeh also visted OPEC members Gabon, Algeria and Libya. The Iranian news agency, IRNA, quoted him as saying before leaving Tripoli that OPEC should do everything possible to make oil prices permanently stable.  REUTER &#3;

A Japanese trading house recently bought about 31,000 tonnes of soybeans for April 10/May 10 shipment, they said.     "Because Brazilian soybean prices are now some 10 cents a bushel cheaper than U.S. Origin due to the bumper harvest, it is highly likely that Japanese crushers will increase their buying volume," one source said.

Metal Traders said in a statement the contract would underpin the worldwide zinc, copper and lead trading activities of Austmet, a wholly-owned London-based company with a U.S. Unit in Stamford, Connecticut.     Austmet has recruited a group of base metal traders, currently operating out of Britain and the U.S., Who have handled Asturiana's business for the past five years, it said.     Asturiana has a three-year option to purchase 25 pct of the Austmet group, to be priced on an independent valuation at the time of exercise, Metal Traders said.     Austmet will have an initial equity base of one mln stg, a turnover of 200 mln Australian dlrs rising to 300 mln in the first year, and credit lines of up to 30 mln U.S. Dlrs.     Austmet should be generating profits from July 1 and a 1.5-2.5 mln dlr net is envisaged within two years, it said.     Metal Traders said Asturiana has the largest zinc smelting capacity in Europe -- nearly 200,000 tonnes a year of 99.995 pct high-grade zinc, at Aviles in northern Spain.     Metal Traders, a listed company, was formerly &lt;Pyrotech Resources N.L.> whose chief activity was the development and marketing of high-technology smelting processes invented in Australia, notably the Siromelt Zinc Fuming Process.     But in late 1986, control of the company changed and it expanded by acquisition into metal trading in Australia and Asia. It then changed its name.     It also has the marketing contract for mineral sands produced by &lt;TiO2 Corp N.L.>, of which it holds 17.5 pct.     In today's statement, Metal Traders also said it is reviewing possible acquisition of a mineral producer.  REUTER &#3;
crude	SAUDI ARABIA'S KING FAHD WANTS STABLE OIL PRICES .  King Fahd said today Saudi Arabia wants oil price stability and he called on non-OPEC producers to avoid harmful competition with the 13 nation group.     His plea, in an interview with Reuters and the television news agency Visnews, came ahead of a state visit he will make to Britain later this month.     King Fahd was asked whether Saudi Arabia would be prepared to reduce its oil output below its OPEC quota of 4.133 mln barrels per day (bpd) to defend the 18 dlr benchmark price agreed to by OPEC last December.     The King replied: "Saudi Arabia doesn't decide prices by itself but certainly desires price stability."     Non-OPEC countries "must help us in a framework of common interest so that there is no type of competition which could prove harmful to everyone," he said.     Asked if he saw the 18 dlr per barrel benchmark as a first step towards higher world oil prices, King Fahd said it was not for Saudi Arabia but for all OPEC countries to determine such issues. Iran and Algeria have already called for a higher benchmark.     In recent weeks the 18 dlr level has come under pressure, due partly to quota violations by some OPEC members. King Fahd said Saudi Arabia, the world's largest oil exporter, was adhering to decisions made at OPEC's December conference which set a 15.8 mln bpd output ceiling for the first half of 1987.     A major non-OPEC producer, Britain has so far resisted the group's pleas to curb its North Sea oil output.     The King also urged the world community to help the Palestinians return to their homeland and called for a peaceful end to the Iran-Iraq war. The 6-1/2-year-old war could not be resolved on the battlefield, he said.  REUTER &#3;

bop	ECONOMIC SPOTLIGHT - CHINA'S FOREIGN DEBT UP .  China's foreign debt reached 27 billion dlrs by the end of 1986, but despite an over-exposure to short-term credits and yen borrowing, China remains very creditworthy with an improved 1987 export outlook, foreign bankers and Chinese officials told Reuters.     Foreign bankers said China's total debt rose sharply from an estimated 20 billion dlrs at end-1985 to cover increased import commitments but the debt/equity ratio remains low, between eight and 10 pct.     China remains a cautious and popular borrower, they said.     Zhang Haoruo, vice minister of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade, said last Friday that China signed foreign loan agreements for 6.94 billion dlrs last year, 96.6 pct up on 1985, with actual loans amounting to 4.83 billion, up 93 pct.     Officials said China would borrow 25 to 30 billion dlrs in the 1986-90 five year plan period, but foreign bankers said they estimate foreign loans at 30 to 40 billion.     A Western banker said China's portfolio contains too much short-term debt and too much of it is denominated in yen as a result of aggressive lending by Japanese banks and attractive low interest rates in the Japanese market.     The strong yen appreciation has cost China dearly and is likely to make it reduce new yen borrowings, the banker said.     A Chinese trade official estimated the yen component of the country's total debt at about 30 pct.     The Peking representative of a Japanese securities house said the rapid yen rise had caught China and his firm unawares.     "Interest rates in Japan are at a historical low, but China, which will remain an active borrower this year, is likely to go elsewhere for capital, to get a better currency spread," he said.     The Western banker said the excess of short-term loans is in part a result of China's inexperience in the foreign capital markets, which it entered only in the early 1980s.     "Officials do not think of China but of their own department or firm. Some loans that were entered into did not have the full backing of the People's Republic of China," he said.     "The dilemma for China, in foreign borrowing as in other areas, is to balance central control with giving reasonable autonomy to firms. It is searching for the mechanisms to exercise indirect controls," he said.     The banker said officials have stressed repeatedly over the past six weeks that China's foreign borrowing will not be affected by a drive against "bourgeois liberalism," a phrase meaning Western political ideas, following the dismissal of Communist Party chief Hu Yaobang on January 16.     A U.S. Banker said there is no evidence that China's foreign exchange reserves have fallen below the officially stated figure of 10 billion dlrs.     "The Bank of China is both a buyer and a seller in the market, which would know quickly if it was buying heavily in advance of an announcement the reserves were down," he said.     The banker said such buying has not been going on. "Things are normal. Trade deficits such as China had last year and in 1985 are normal for a country at its stage of development."     Customs figures show China had a trade deficit of 11.9 billion dlrs in 1986, down from 14 billion in 1985.     A Ministry of Foreign Economic Relations and Trade official said this year's outlook for exports, which account for more than 75 pct of foreign exchange earnings, is much healthier than a year ago.     The renminbi has matched the U.S. Dollar fall, he said. It was quoted at 3.72 today, little changed from 3.7 a year ago.     The official said China has taken measures to improve its export performance, including incentive offers to exporters and the establishment of export production bases.     "We expect higher prices for our oil exports this year," he added.     Official estimates put China's 1986 export losses from the drop in world oil prices at three billion dlrs.     A Western diplomat said China's foreign debt needs careful management but its debt service ratio remains very low at six to eight pct.     "We base our assessment not on China's foreign exchange reserves but on its export performance, just as you assess a company on its performance, not its bank account," he said.     He said China performed very well in the export field last year and remains a very creditworthy country which will have few difficulties in increasing its borrowing.  REUTER &#3;
earn	ULTRAMAR SAYS FOURTH QUARTER SHOWED IMPROVEMENTS .  Ultramar Plc &lt;UMAR.L> said that while its fourth 1986 quarter had improved from the operational point of view, several special charges adversely affected results.     Overall the year had not been a good one, with upstream operations dramatically hit by the fall in crude oil prices and downstream operations also affected in the first half by large losses on inventories.     But margins improved in the second half and in particular refining and marketing in Eastern Canada showed a good recovery.     The company was commenting on results that showed a net loss for the year of 62.1 mln stg after a 71.6 mln profit in 1985.     The fourth quarter charges included a 20.8 mln stg provision on a retroactive price agreement recently initialled by Pertamina and Japanese buyers of the company's liquid natural gas and 4.7 mln for the early months of its ownership of Gulf Canada's marketing assets.     Ultramar said it had also included the estimated cost of a further reorganisation programme, which was partly offset by a withdrawal of surplus funds from U.S. Pension schemes, and a 13.5 mln stg provision for the estimated cost of selling its U.S. Flag shipping operation.     The immediate outlook for crude oil prices was uncertain although it was unlikely there would be any sizeable increase in the near term. However, Ultramar said it was optimistic prices would strengthen over the longer term.     Its substantial reserves of crude oil and natural gas put it in a good position to benefit from any price recovery.     In the meantime, Ultramar's objectives were to improve profitability by selling or restructuring weak operations while strengthening core businesses and developing a sound operational and financial base.     Proven, probable and possible reserves at end-1986 totalled about 700 mln barrels net on an oil-equivalent basis.     Ultramar shares firmed on the announcement to 187p from 181p at last night's close.  REUTER &#3;

The spokesman said that under current regulations, the EC would have to accept all the offers if there were no technical problems.     The spokesman said the Commission would only have to reimburse the member state for the cost of buying-in the sugar after the product was sold out of intervention stores at a later date.     He said that at present there was virtually no sugar held in intervention stores.     Last year, 45,000 tonnes were sold into intervention and during the 1984-85 campaign 108,000 tonnes.  REUTER &#3;
interest,money-fx	INDONESIAN BANKS RAISE INTEREST RATES .  A tight money market has pushed interest rates on three to six month time deposits to between 15 and 18 pct from 13 to 15 pct a month ago, bankers said.     March is usually a tight month for the money market because of tax payments and banks' need to attract funds for their year-end accounts on March 31.     This year the situation has been made worse by December's rush to buy dollars by companies and businessmen who feared imposition of exchange controls. Much of that outflow has yet to be converted back into rupiah.     "A lot of small money has come back in, but the big money is holding out until after April," one U.S. Banker said.     The tight money policy of Bank Indonesia, the central bank, is helping to keep rates high.     Short-term lending rates now average 25 pct a year, with no prospect they will be lowered soon, the bankers said.     Central Bank governor Arifin Siregar said earlier this week that Indonesia could look forward to better economic prospects in 1987/88, but added the "speculators" who led a run on the rupiah late last year could again pose problems.     Indonesia holds general elections on April 23, the first in five years, and most businessmen expect no new government economic packages or incentives before then.     "Some people are nervous about what the government will do after the election," one banker said. "They normally try to do things before the IGGI (Inter-Governmental Group on Indonesia) meeting (in June) to prove they are doing something about the economy to show they deserve a couple of billion dollars."     The IGGI, which groups 14 industrialised donor countries and four agencies, gave Indonesia 2.5 billion dlrs in soft loans and grants last year.  REUTER &#3;

But profits "will be at a satisfactory level," the company said in the annual report without giving a specific estimate.     Highveld said it expects appreciation of the rand will be offset to some extent by increasing U.S. Dollar prices for its exports as the year progresses.     Highveld said measures taken last year by the European Economic Community and the United States prohibiting all South African steel products "presents a challenge to management to place the steel in other areas."     The company said overall world vanadium consumption in 1987 is expected to be similar to last year although China's role is still an unknown factor in the total supply-demand situation.     "World vanadium production capacity is still believed to be adequate to cater for any foreseeable demand," it added.  REUTER &#3;

earn	PREUSSAG SAYS PAYMENT OF A 1986 DIVIDEND NOT CERTAIN .  A spokesman for Preussag AG &lt;PRSG.F> said it was not yet certain whether the company would pay a dividend on 1986 results     He was commenting on a Preussag statement which said results in 1986 were lower than in 1985. Preussag has frequently said its results came under further pressure in 1986 following a difficult year in 1985.     Managing board chairman Guenther Sassmannshausen said in December the board would prefer to stick to its policy of not dipping into reserves to pay dividends. The spokesman noted the final dividend decision rests with the supervisory board.     The Preussag statement said results fell in 1986 compared with 1985 because declines in earnings in metals, oil and shipping were not entirely compensated by positive trends in the group's other divisions.     The spokesman said it was not clear whether the domestic group would show a net profit in 1986, adding this would depend partly on the level of provisions.     Preussag cut its 1985 dividend to eight marks from nine marks on 1984 results after parent company net profit dropped to 65.0 mln marks from 103.0 mln the year before.     The Preussag world group made a net loss of 13.1 mln marks in 1985 after a net profit of 154.5 mln the year before. Domestic group net profit fell to 77.9 mln from 122.2 mln.     The statement said its results in 1986 were affected by unsatisfactory selling prices for metals and oil as well as by poor use of capacity in the supply ship sector.     The reduction in natural gas prices in the fourth quarter of 1986 to reflect earlier falls in oil prices was an additional factor behind the drop in results.     Preussag said rationalization measures already introduced would not begin to take full effect until this year.     Preussag's domestic group turnover rose to 4.48 billion marks in 1986 from 4.29 billion in 1985, helped by the first time consolidation of 951.8 mln marks of turnover from its majority-owned oil and gas subsidiary C. Deilmann AG.     Domestic group turnover in the 1986 fourth quarter alone was 1.1 billion marks, it said without giving comparison figures.     Preussag said its domestic crude oil production fell 4.0 pct to 94,400 tonnes in 1986, while foreign oil production rose to 182,900 tonnes from 174,500 tonnes.     Preussag said its Amalgamated Metal Corporation Plc (AMC) subsidiary, whose results are included in the world group accounts, made an unspecified profit in the fourth quarter of last year.     AMC's large losses in 1985, caused principally by the international tin crisis, were the reason behind the world group losses that year.  REUTER &#3;

Actual spending last year fell short of the budgeted figure of 3.2 billion dlrs, as oil companies slashed expenditure because of the crash in world oil prices.

Jumardi Jukardi, head of Pertamina's foreign contractors coordinating board, gave no details about the outcome of the talks.     But Pertamina President Abdul Rachman Ramly has said priority will be given to extending contracts for companies whose exploration and production contracts expire within the next seven to 10 years.     Jukardi, speaking to Indonesian reporters, said the negotiations would determine whether the 85-15 production sharing split in favour of Pertamina would be adhered to or altered in some cases as oil companies are asking for.     Hardjoko Seputro, spokesman for the Mines and Energy Ministry, has said that President Suharto has agreed in principle to extension of the standard 30-year production sharing contract to reflect better current depressed conditions on the international oil market.

sugar	TRADE SAYS EC SUGAR TENDER HARD TO FORECAST .  Traders here and in Paris said the results of today's EC white sugar tender are hard to forecast because of plans by a group of French, West German, Dutch and Belgian operators to sell one mln tonnes of sugar into intervention.     London traders said bids for licences have been reported between 43.00 and 44.00 Ecus per 100 kilos and if any licences are granted they are likely to be towards the lower end of that range, possibly 43.30/43.50 Ecus.     Traders in Paris said they expect maximum rebates of between 43 and 43.50 Ecus.     Other than the Commission releasing no sugar for export, the likely tonnage is expected to be very small, the London traders said, while the French sources declined to estimate volume in view of the psychological impact of the planned sales into intervention in protest against EC export policies.     Last week licences for 60,500 tonnes were awarded at a maximum rebate of 43.147 Ecus.  REUTER &#3;
trade,bop	KOREA PLANS TO OPEN MARKETS TO EASE WON PRESSURE .  South Korea will further open its market to help cut its trade surplus with the U.S. And to fight off pressure to revalue the won against the dollar, a government spokesman said.     The spokesman said Korean trade minister Rha Woong-Bae's stand in Washington yesterday against pressure from industrial nations to revalue the won underlined the government's determination to stand firm.     Rha told the U.S. Chamber of Commerce "Demands that Korea carry out a drastic and sudden currency revaluation of five or 10 pct are, I believe, extremely ill-advised."     Deputy prime minister Kim Mahn-Je told a meeting of local businessmen "The government's policy on the question of revaluing the won is to maintain a steadfast position."     Kim said South Korea was ready to move slowly to raise the won's value because of its heavy foreign debt which stood at 44.5 billion dlrs at the end of 1986.     Six industrialised nations agreed in Paris last month that newly industrialising countries, such as South Korea and Taiwan, should allow their currencies to appreciate.     But local businessmen have said won/dollar parity has already reached "a crisis level."     An official of the Korea Traders' Association (KTA) said if the won strengthened another five pct, this would mean the loss of profitability for nearly half of all South Korean exporters.     "We are determined not to go the way of Latin American debtor nations which have suspended interest payments of their debts," the spokesman said. "The only way to keep our good record is to maintain our exports.+     The trade minister said yesterday should Seoul revalue the won suddenly Korea would run "a tremendous trade deficit and could degenerate into a country, like many other developing countries, which is reneging on its international obligations."     The spokesman said South Korea had been gradually appreciating its currency, ruling out a major revaluation. So far this year, the won has gone up by 0.8 pct against the dollar after a 3.34 pct revaluation in 1986.     He said South Korea was selecting "many" of 122 items on which Washington recently asked Seoul to lower tariffs to help narrow its trade surplus with the U.S. No further details were given.     Seoul announced in January the lifting of bans on 158 items, including sensitive agricultural products and large cars, effective from July.     South Korea posted its first ever current account surplus last year, due largely to a trade surplus with the U.S. Of 7.1 billion dlrs, against a 4.3 billion deficit in 1985. It earlier forecast that its current account surplus could reach eight billion dlrs this year.     But the government official said the surplus would be held at around five billion dlrs to avoid further pressure by industrialised nations to push up the value of its currency.  REUTER &#3;
money-fx	GERMAN CALL MONEY EASES AFTER LIQUIDITY INJECTION .  Call money eased to 3.75/80 pct from 3.80/85 yesterday following a net injection of 6.7 billion marks at a rate of 3.80 pct in fresh funds from this week's securities repurchase agreement, dealers said.     But rates were expected to rise toward the end of the week.     A major tax payment period by banks on behalf of customers, payments for the federal railways loan stock and repayments of mark liabilities incurred by foreign central banks with the Bundesbank in the framework of the European Monetary System (EMS) are likely to significantly burden the system. Banks built up minimum reserves today, ahead of the expected outflow.     The Bundesbank credited banks with a gross 15.2 billion marks, but some 8.5 billion left the system at the same time as an earlier securities repurchase pact matured.     Dealers estimated the EMS related outflow as high as six billion marks.     The Bundesbank declined to comment, but a spokesman said yesterday although the funds now due may be allowed to roll over, the possibility that other central banks may choose to redeem them meant a net infusion was needed.     Dealers forecast tax payments of 25 and 30 billion marks, but much of it is expected to burden the system only next week.     Banks' minimum reserve holdings at the Bundesbank totalled 53.6 billion marks on Monday, averaging 54.0 billion over the first nine days of March.     Dealers said although the figure was well above an expected requirement of around 51 billion marks, the expected outflow of funds was so large that banks might find it difficult to meet the requirement toward the end of March.     No securities repurchase agreement is expiring next week, but dealers said the Bundesbank could offer fresh liquidity if conditions significantly tighten. "The Bundesbank wants to keep rates around 3.80 pct," one dealer said.  REUTER &#3;

The yen's rise against the dollar is expected to boost Japan's unemployment rate to an average 3.3 pct in the 1987/88 fiscal year beginning April 1 from January's record three pct, the private Nomura Research Institute said.     The official 1987/88 estimate is 2.9 pct.     The research arm of Nomura Securities Co forecast unemployment would exceed two mln by mid-fiscal 1987, against an estimated 1.75 mln for the current year.     Nomura urged the government to take pump-priming measures to help redress trade imbalances and boost employment.     Employment in manufacturing during fiscal 1987/88 was predicted to fall 550,000 from the current year due to higher job losses in the steel, shipbuilding and heavy electrical machinery sectors, Nomura said.     Employment in the non-manufacturing sector will continue to increase, the institute said, without giving figures.  REUTER &#3;
money-supply,interest	SPAIN EXTENDS RESERVE REQUIREMENT .  The Bank of Spain has extended the reserve requirement for banks to their convertible peseta funds in an attempt to curb speculation in short-term capital which is currently fuelling money supply growth.     In a statement issued late last night, the central bank said convertible peseta accounts, funds which are not subject to exchange controls, would also be subject to a 19 pct reserve requirement with effect from Friday.     Convertible peseta funds had been previously exempt from reserve requirements.     The measure comes one week after the central bank raised reserve requirements on domestic deposits by one percentage point to 19 pct, also with effect on Friday.     Banking sources say the high real interest rates on offer now -- around eight pct for overnight funds -- have attracted a large influx of speculative foreign capital which is threatening the government's monetary targets.     They say this influx is largely responsible for Spain's principal measure of money supply, the broad-based liquid assets in public hands (ALP), to have grown by an estimated 17 pct annualised rate in February, compared with January's 8.3 pct rise and an 11.4 pct rise during the whole of 1986. The target for 1987 is eight pct.     The Bank of Spain today did not provide assistance funds to banks in a move to drain excess liquidity from the money market. Liquidity will be further tightened by the fortnightly Treasury Bill auction tomorrow and Friday's hike in reserve requirements, expected to absorb over 200 billion pesetas from the system.     The immediate reaction was a hike in interbank interest rates today to 13.75/14.00 pct from yesterday's 13.46 pct average for deposits.     Bank of Spain officials said this was an understandable response "given that the market is short of funds."     But banking sources noted that a continued rise in interest rates would neutralize the central bank's attempts to curtail short-term speculation with foreign funds by making the Spanish money markets more attractive.

Bank of Japan governor Satoshi Sumita said there is little room left for the central bank to further ease its credit policy as interest rates levels are now approaching their lower limit.

His remarks were concerned with a comprehensive economic stimulative package the government plans to adopt in the coming days.     At the recent talks among the six major industrialised nations in Paris, Japan promised to work out a comprehensive economic package to boost domestic demand, which in turn would help increase its imports and reduce its trade surplus.     Sumita also said the economy will show a gradual upturn in the second half of the year if the yen remains stable.     He said there is caution in the foreign exchange market against a further rise of the yen and mark and this explains the recent stability in the currency markets. Conflicting economic indicators from the U.S. Have also been dampening market activity, he added.  REUTER &#3;

Westpac's chief economist Bob Graham said the consistent upward trend in the leading index emphasised the need for a tough mini-budget in May. "An untoward increase in consumption spending before the balance of payments improves would have disastrous consequences," he said.     The coincident index also rose an annualised three pct in December against zero movement in November and a seven pct rise a year earlier, Westpac and the Institute said.     They said this index continued to show the current recession is shallow and is more likely to involve a slowing in real growth than an absolute fall in economic activity.  REUTER &#3;

"A further stronger yen would be a misfortune for Japan and the Japanese people would not be able to bear such a burden," he told reporters.     The minister said he wants to tell U.S. Political leaders of the sacrifices Japan is making to cut its trade surplus.     Kuranari was widely expected to fly to Washington tomorrow for talks focussing on trade. But departure remains uncertain because of the continuing parliamentary boycott by opposition parties protesting plans for a new sales tax.     If the boycott is lifted tomorrow, Kuranari would probably have to remain in Japan to attend parliamentary discussions on the government's 1987/88 budget, Japanese officials said.     Kuranari said both the U.S. And Japan should approach the trade imbalance in a calm, unemotional manner.     But, he added, "If the issue of rice is to be raised...I would mention the feelings of the Japanese people."     Japanese politicians have said repeatedly the country cannot bow to U.S. Pressure to liberalize rice imports because the issue is too sensitive.  REUTER &#3;

interest	U.S. URGES BANKS TO WEIGH PHILIPPINE DEBT PLAN .  The U.S. is urging reluctant commercial banks to seriously consider accepting a novel Philippine proposal for paying its interest bill and believes the innovation is fully consistent with its Third World debt strategy, a Reagan administration official said.     The official's comments also suggest that debtors' pleas for interest rate concessions should be treated much more seriously by the commercial banks, in cases where developing nations are carrying out genuine economic reforms.     In addition, he signaled that the banks might want to reconsider the idea of a "megabank," where Third World debt would be pooled, and suggested the administration would support such a plan, even though it was not formally proposing it. At the same time, however, the official expressed reservations that such a scheme would ever get off the ground.     The Philippine proposal, together with Argentine suggestions that "exit bonds" be issued to end the troublesome role of small banks in the debt strategy, would help to underpin the flagging role of private banks within the plan, the official said in an interview with Reuters.     "All of these things would fit within the definition of our initiative as we have asked it and we think any novel and unique approach such as those should be considered," said the official, who asked not to be named.     In October 1985, Washington outlined a debt crisis strategy under which commercial banks and multilateral institutions such as the World Bank and the International Monetary Fund (IMF) were urged to step up lending to major debtors nations.     In return, America called on the debtor countries to enact economic reforms promoting inflation-free economic growth.     "The multilaterals have been performing well, the debtors have been performing well," said the official. But he admitted that the largest Third World debtor, Brazil, was clearly an exception.     The official, who played a key role in developing the U.S. Debt strategy and is an administration economic policymaker, also said these new ideas would help commercial banks improve their role in resolving the Third World debt crisis.     "We called at the very beginning for the bank syndications to find procedures or processes whereby they could operate more effectively," the official said.     Among those ideas, the official said, were suggestions that commercial banks create a "megabank" which could swap Third World debt paper for so-called "exit bonds" for banks like regional American or European institutions.     Such bonds in theory would rid these banks of the need to lend money to their former debtors every time a new money package was assembled, and has been suggested by Argentina in its current negotiations for a new loan of 2.15 billion dlrs.     He emphasised that the "megabank" was not an administration plan but "something some people have suggested."     Other U.S. Officials said Japanese commercial banks are examining the creation of a consortium bank to assume Third World debt. This plan, actively under consideration, would differ slightly from the one the official described.     But the official expressed deep misgivings that such a plan would work in the United States.     "If the banks thought that that was a suitable way to go, fine. I don't think they ever will."     He pointed out that banks would swap their Third World loans for capital in the megabank and might then be reluctant to provide new money to debtors through the new institution.     Meanwhile, the official praised the Philippine plan under which it would make interest payments on its debt in cash at no more than 5/8 pct above Libor.     "The Philippine proposal is very interesting, it's quite unique and I don't think it's something that should be categorically rejected out of hand," the official said.     Banks which found this level unacceptably low would be offered an alternative of Libor payments in cash and a margin above that of one pct in the form of Philippine Investment Notes.     These tradeable, dollar-denominated notes would have a six-year life and if banks swapped them for cash before maturity, the country would guarantee a payment of 7/8 point over Libor.     Until now, bankers have criticised these spreads as far too low. The talks, now in their second week, are aimed at stretching out repayments of 3.6 billion dlrs of debt and granting easier terms on 5.8 billion of already rescheduled debt. The country, which has enjoyed strong political support in Washington since Corazon Aquino came to power early last year, owes an overall 27.8 billion dlrs of debt.     But the official denied the plan amounts to interest rate capitalisation, a development until now unacceptable to the banks. "It's no more interest rate capitalisation than if you have a write down in the spread over Libor from what existed before," the official said in comments suggesting some ought to be granted the rate concessions they seek. "Some people argue that (cutting the spread) is debt forgiveness... What it really is is narrowing the spread on new money," he added.     He said the U.S. Debt strategy is sufficiently broad as an initiative to include plans like the Philippines'.  Reuter &#3;
money-fx,stg,can	POUND AND CANADIAN DOLLAR CAPTURING ATTENTION .  Interest in the currency futures market has shifted to the soaring British pound and the potentially explosive Canadian dollar, and away from the dull Continental and Japanese currencies, analysts said.     The June pound, which added 6.3 cents over the past week-and-a-half to reach a new contract high of 1.5930 to the dollar on Monday, has spawned a new-found speculative boom.     "Brokers have to push their clients somewhere...and technically, the pound is in the best shape," PaineWebber analyst Jason Gillard said.     "We've tried to take a bullish approach to the pound, and we're going to stay with that, there's no reason to change," Smith Barney analyst Craig Sloane said.     Many traders took on long pound/short West German mark futures positions, although some of those cross-trades were liquidated yesterday, Sloane said.      The fundamental keys to the pound's rise have been relatively high U.K. interest rates and a vague optimism surrounding the British economy, analysts said.     "Money seems to be chasing yields," William Byers, of Bear Stearns, said of the 10-1/2 pct U.K. base lending rate.     Many analysts are skeptical about further gains in the pound, on the inference that the Bank of England will seek to relieve upward pressure on the currency by pushing down interest rates after the nation's budget is released March 17.     The budget itself could have an impact, depending on how well it is received, but analysts say relative interest rates and oil income remain the main influences on the currency.     However, the market may be able to absorb lower U.K. interest rates, as it has done when other countries have cut their discount rates, and extend the pound's rally, Sloane said.     The Canadian dollar has not been rising like the pound, but Sloane and other analysts cautiously predicted a big move soon.     The sideways price pattern in the June contract, with smaller and smaller price ranges, has formed a "bull flag" on price charts, technically-oriented analysts said.     "It makes for an explosive type of situation that often leads to a breakout," in this case to the upside, Sloane said.     Byers agreed there was potential for the June Canadian dollar to rally above the 77.00 cent level from the most recent close at 74.80 cents to the U.S. dollar.     "At this stage of the game I'd call the market long-term positive, but for the technical burden of proof you need a close above (the previous contract high of) 75.25," Byers said.     As to the traditionally more active currencies, stability was the catchword and reluctance the watchword among analysts.     Sloane said it was important that June Swiss francs and June German marks held above support at 0.6400 and 0.5400, respectively, closing at 0.6438 and 0.5430.     Yesterday's rebound showed the market was still very respectful of the Paris accord, and the threat of central bank intervention by the G-5 nations plus Canada.     "We may still probe to see what the parameters are," Byers said, "but people are very reluctant because they don't know where the central banks will be (to intervene)."     Gillard said the mark could drop to a previous price consolidation area around 0.5250 based on the profoundly sluggish West German economy, but that he would be a buyer at that level.  Reuter &#3;
interest	JAMAICA AGREES DRAFT BANK DEBT RESCHEDULING .  Jamaica agreed in principle with its bank advisory committee on a rescheduling of 181 mln dlrs of foreign commercial bank debt falling due between 1987 and 1989, the Jamaican Information Service said.     Repayments on the debt will be stretched out over 12 years with 8-1/2 years' grace at 1-1/4 percentage points over the London Interbank Offered Rate, Libor. The margin on previously restructured debt also will be cut to 1-1/4 point from 2-1/2.     The package should save Jamaica about 3.3 mln dlrs a year.     Prime Minister Edward Seaga, who led the Jamaican delegation, called the terms very favourable to his country.     The agreement in principle with the bank advisory committee led by the Bank of Nova Scotia &lt;BNO.TO> comes five days after Jamaica successfully concluded a 125.5 mln dlr rescheduling accord with the Paris Club of creditor nations.     That pact in turn followed the International Monetary Fund (IMF)'s approval on March 5 of a 85 mln special drawing rights standby arrangement and a 40.9 mln sdr drawing under the compensatory financing facility.     Of Jamaica's foreign debt of 3.3 billion dlrs only 12 pct is owed to commercial banks, and Seaga yesterday reaffirmed the government's policy of not seeking new bank loans. REUTER...^M &#3;
oilseed,soybean,veg-oil,palm-oil,coconut-oil	VEGETABLE OILS MAY TIGHTEN DESPITE SEED SURPLUS .  Lower production of coconut and palm oils could lead to a decline in vegetable oil stocks this year despite growing supplies of oilseeds, senior oilseeds analyst for Merrill Lynch Capital Markets Mario Balletto said.     Balletto told a conference of Canadian farmers at Alberta Agriculture's annual farm outlook conference that the world vegetable oil situation is one of potentially tight supplies.     "Prices for edible oils appear to have more upside potential reflecting strong world demand and an unprecedented decline in the production of tree oils," Balletto said.     Balletto estimated production of palm, coconut and palm kernel oils this year at 8.5 mln tonnes, down from 9.1 mln tonnes last year, enough to offset higher oilseed output.     He estimated total vegetable oil production this year at 33.4 mln tonnes, up from 33.0 mln last year, and disappearance at 34.0 mln tonnes, up from 32.6 mln.     Unless oilseed crushing increases sharply, he said, disappearance of vegetable oils could exceed production by 600,000 tonnes, the largest deficit since 1976.     "If world protein meal demand stagnates, thus limiting the crush of soybeans ... the need for serious supply rationing in the edible oils sector could develop," he said.     "This would be relatively favorable for the prices of high oil yielding seeds," Balletto said.     Oilseeds, on the other hand, remain at depressed prices because of burdensome supplies, he said.     World ending stocks of oilseeds are estimated to increase for the fourth straight year to a record 28.4 mln tonnes, compared with 25.4 mln last year.     The increase should result from lower disappearance, as production is expected to fall to 184.0 mln tonnes from 185.7 mln last year, he said.     World soybean production in 1987 totalled a record 98.9 mln tonnes, up from 90.6 mln the previous year, Balletto said, while production of other oilseeds was lower.     Higher soybean production in South America and Europe made up for lower production in the United States, he said.     Soybeans account for the bulk of the surplus, and U.S. stocks make up most of those, Balletto said.     The Commodity Credit Corporation owned 12.7 mln tonnes, about half of the world soybean surplus, he said.     Since 1983-84, he said, world oilseed stocks have increased 13.1 mln tonnes.     "During the same period, U.S. soybean stocks increased 12.1 mln tonnes, becoming the dumping ground of the entire world surplus, courtesy of the CCC and highlighting the artificially high prices caused by the U.S. loan program."     "Soybean prices and, to a great extent, world oilseeds prices are likely to be dominated by the loan program, as long as the U.S. soybean surplus continues.     For the 1987 crop, he said, prices are likely to hover in a range tied to the U.S. loan program.     "Upside potential for prices is limited by the huge supply overhang while strong underlying support is provided by the U.S. loan rate."     The problem is likely to become worse as the artificially high prices encourage producers in South America, Canada and Australia to shift from grains to oilseeds, Balletto said.  Reuter &#3;

interest	BRAZIL'S GROS TO MEET BANKS ON TRADE LINE ISSUE .  Brazil's central bank governor Francisco Gros will meet senior commercial bankers here today in a new attempt to defuse the anger generated by the country's unilateral suspension of interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of foreign commercial bank debt, bankers said.     Gros will meet representatives of Citibank, the head of Brazil's bank advisory committee, and of co-heads Morgan Guaranty Trust Co and Lloyds Bank Plc.     High on the agenda will be banks' complaints about Brazil's accompanying freeze on some 15 billion dlrs of short-term trade and interbank lines, the bankers said.     Brazil's several hundred creditor banks worldwide agreed last March to extend the credit lines until March 31, 1987, as part of a 31 billion dlr financing package.     Bankers said the looming expiry of this commitment, coupled with Brazil's freeze, raised a spate of technical and legal questions that the banks want to discuss with Gros.     They said they face problems because of the freeze requirement that any payment due to be made by a Brazilian bank under the trade facility must be deposited instead with the central bank. This means foreign bankers cannot easily switch their credit lines from one borrower to another.     The requirement to deposit with the central bank has also meant Brazilian banks have been able to negotiate lower interest-rate spreads, because foreign banks would rather accept a reduced margin than see their money deposited with the central bank.     "It's caused a lot of ill-will with the banking community," one banker said.     Gros is also expected to brief the banks on the results of a 10-day tour of Europe and Japan that he and finance minister Dilson Funaro have just completed to seek official support for Brazil's debt stance.

There is little chance Soviet exports to the United States will rise in 1987, but Moscow's current trade reforms should result in more trade in manufactured goods in future, a Soviet economist said.     Sergey Frolov, chief economist at Amtorg Trading Corp, an agent for Soviet trade organisations and industries, told a U.S.-USSR business meeting the Soviet Union produces few items that western nations want.     But reforms, including upgrading the quality of goods and allowing joint ventures with foreign firms, will encourage modest export gains in future.     Frolov said the Soviet Union exported 500 mln dlrs worth of goods to the United States in 1986 and imported 1.5 billion dlrs worth. He gave no trade forecast for 1987.     But he said that even if all obstacles were removed, total trade between the two countries would remain between two and three billion dlrs a year.     "The post-detente embargoes have taught the USSR to limit its trading with the U.S.," he said.  REUTER &#3;

Espinosa said yesterday the pipeline, which carries crude from jungle fields to the Pacific Ocean coast of Balao, would be repaired with the help of Texaco Inc &lt;TX.N> and a Mexican and an Argentine firm.

crude	TALKING POINT/OIL SERVICES TURNAROUND SEEN .  The oil services industry is on the verge of a recovery because of rising crude prices, oil industry analysts said.     The analysts, who issued buy recommendations on some stocks, said the recovery in oil services should begin in the second half of 1987, after drilling activity bottoms out in the first half, and continue into the next decade.      "People, however, cannot afford to wait for drilling to go up to start buying," said Sandi Haber Sweeney, senior research analyst at Sanford C. Bernstein and Co Inc.     Among the recommended buys are Schlumberger Ltd &lt;SLB>, Halliburton Co &lt;HAL>, Dresser Industries &lt;DI>, Baker International &lt;BKO>, and McDermott International Inc &lt;MDR>, which may be the target of a takeover by Harold Simmons, a Dallas-based investor.     Analysts said although major oil companies are increasing exploration and development overseas, they expect the pickup in oil services will begin in the U.S.     "Activity in the U.S. is so depressed it should move up faster," said Vishnu Sharp of Goldman Sachs.     The number of active oil drilling rigs in the U.S. was 766 last week compared with 1,212 rigs one year ago, Huges Tool Co &lt;HT> figures show.     The average number of working rigs in the U.S. for 1987 is projected at 978 versus 964 in 1986, according to Ike Kerridge, vice president of stockholder relations at Hughes Tool. "The first significant pickup in drilling activity will occur in the second half of 1988," Kerridge said.     Overseas drilling activity is expected to follow a similar pattern, Kerridge said.     "Halliburton is the best value," said Jeffrey Freedman, vice president at Smith Barney, Harris and Upham Inc, adding the company controls the greatest amount of liquidity of common stock market value, is diversifed in non-oil field businesess, and has the lowest multiple of stock price to operating cash flow including debt.     Schlumberger is Freedman's second favorite oil service stock.     "Schlumberger is expected to continue to be the dominant technical leader in the industry," Freedman said.     "Schlumberger's management shift, asset restructuring, including a pending merger of Fairchild Semiconductor, and its considerable cash horde sets the stage for the company to maximize its significant industry advantage and capitalize on the project upturn in exploration and development activity," according to a report by George Gaspar, first vice president at Robert W. Baird and Co Inc.     Gaspar estimates earnings per share for Schlumberger at 25 cts for 1987 and one to 1.75 dlrs in 1988 compared with 20 cts in 1986 excluding a fourth quarter special charge of 1.87 billion dlrs.     Bernstein's Sandi Sweeney is recommending a group of oil service companies and said choosing among them is difficult. Her favorite is Baker International, which is involved in a possible merger with Hughes Tool Co.     Dresser Industries will also benefit from the recovery but possibly not as much as other companies because it is not a pure service company, Sweeney said.     Dresser is expected to improve profitability owing to cost reductions and streamlined operations, including the sale and leaseback of its headquarters, said Swarup.  Reuter &#3;
earn	CREDITANSTALT SEES HIGHER 1987 DIVIDEND .  Creditanstalt-Bankverein &lt;CABV.VI> is likely to raise its 1987 dividend from the 1986 payment of 12 pct of share capital, deputy general-director Guido Schmidt-Chiari said.     The 1985 dividend was 10 pct, unchanged from the previous year and Schmidt-Chiari noted that the parent bank's share capital had risen to 3.1 billion schillings at the end of 1986 from 2.7 billion a year earlier.     Schmidt-Chiari made the forecast at a news conference when the bank announced a 1986 consolidated banking group net profit of 496.7 mln schillings for 1986, against 354.5 mln in 1985.     Schmidt-Chiari did not elaborate on his dividend forecast.     The banking group's consolidated balance sheet total rose to 453.4 billion schillings at year-end from 425.4 billion.     General director Hannes Androsch said higher investment would lead to continuing growth in profits in future. Last year's better profits had resulted from improvements in services provided by the bank and also in profits on schilling lending.     Schilling lending had grown last year and interest rate margins had also improved but remained unsatisfactory when compared with those in other countries, he said.     Increased provisions for possible bad debts at home and abroad, particularly in Latin America, had lowered profits, Androsch said, but declined to give an exact figure.     Schmidt-Chiari said that foreign lending business had fallen significantly due to exchange rate fluctuations, removing some 22 billion schillings from the balance sheet total.     In an attempt to generate more foreign business, representative offices would be opened this year in Tokyo, Hong Kong, Moscow and Prague. Androsch welcomed government plans to abolish legal controls on foreigners buying voting shares and drawing dividends.     Preference shares of state-controlled Creditanstalt rose eight schillings on the Vienna Bourse today to 2,008. Brokers said improved results had been widely expected by investors.     Androsch said industrial holdings had performed better in 1986 than in previous years, giving a return on investment of 2.6 pct compared with 1.3 pct in 1985. Creditanstalt, Austria's largest bank, holds majority interests in 10 medium-sized and large Austrian companies.

crude	OPEC REAFFIRMS COMMITMENT TO FIXED PRICES, CEILING .  OPEC has reaffirmed its commitment to fixed crude oil prices of around 18 dlrs a barrel and an overall output ceiling of 15.8 mln barrels per day (bpd) to defend prices, its president Rilwanu Lukman said.     He told a news conference here "After due consultation with my colleagues in OPEC, I hereby wish to emphasize that Nigeria and all member countries of OPEC remain determined to uphold the December agreement by adhering strictly to their various quotas and official selling prices."     Lukman added no extraordinary OPEC conference was planned.     "We are in a position to re-confirm that, despite misleading news in foreign media to the contrary, ... OPEC member countries as a whole produced below their agreed quota in the month of February," Lukman, who is Nigerian oil minister, said.     Lukman put the overall OPEC output shortfall in February at 900,000 bpd and said this was as a result of their firm determination to defend official selling prices of 18 dlrs agreed upon last December in Geneva.     The December agreement set an overall output ceiling for OPEC of 15.8 mln bpd for first half 1987 and restored fixed prices as from February 1 around a reference point of 18 dlrs.     Oil prices rallied immediately after the Geneva accord but fell again last month on reports that OPEC was producing more than the agreed level.     "The idea was to suggest that OPEC's agreement would not hold and this caused some customers to hold back purchases of OPEC oil and resort to destocking to meet their needs," Lukman said.     He said the 900,000 bpd shortfall last February was based on the verified figure for 10 out of OPEC's 13 members, adding that Nigeria alone had a shortfall in production of 100,000 bpd.     Iraq disassociated itself from the December agreement, while the production figures of Ecuador and the United Arab Emirates needed to be verified, Lukman said.     "If that is the price we have to pay to make the agreement succeed, we are ready ... OPEC is not changing its price level of 18 dlrs," the group's president said.     He said the OPEC price differentials committee meeting formerly postponed to April had been put off indefinitely.     "Furthermore, no extraordinary meeting of the conference is at the moment contemplated since most agreements reached in December are being adhered to," he said.     Asked if the committee did not need to meet soon to narrow the gaps in the prices of the various OPEC crudes -- fixed in relation to the 18 dlr benchmark -- Lukman replied "We consider the defence of our prices much more crucial than differentials."     Lukman said OPEC was aware that consumers had heavily drawn on stocks of both crude oil and refined products to levels well below this time last year and soon they would return to the market in search of crude.     "We don't see that there is going to be any difficulty in maintaining the 18 dlr price throughout the rest of the year," Lukman said.     The OPEC president praised non-OPEC oil producers, which he said had contributed to the group's efforts to stabilise prices, but he criticised Britain for maintaining its long-held view not to do anything to help the market.     "We are quite confident, however, that in the long-term with two-thirds of the world's reserves in OPEC hands, the future is ours. We will use that advantage responsibly," he said.     Lukman described the disruption in Ecuador's output following an earthquake as tragic, but refused to say if the South American country would be allowed a higher output quota when it recovered from the disaster.

It said about five mln dlrs will be spent to continue underground development and obtain operating permits and another 10.2 mln dlrs is expected to be required to complete underground development, construct a mill and provide the infrastructure needed to put the mine into commercial production.     St. Joe Gold said if the necessary operating permits were granted in time, it would start gold production in the second half of the year ending October 31, 1988 at an annual rate of about 40,000 troy ounces.     The company said the property is estimated to contain over 500,000 troy ounces of gold, and the initial mining project covers only seven of 192 claims, with drill-indicated reserves of 293,000 short tons grading 0.88 troy ounce of gold per ton.     It said initial mine output is expected to be about 150 tons of ore daily.     St. Joe Gold said the Golden Patricia vein has not been tested at depth or along strike to the east and west and exploration is continuing on the Golden Patricia property and the adjacent wholly-owned Muskeg Lake property.     The company also said its Richmond Hill gold and silver deposit in the Carbonate district of western South Dakota has been shown by drilling to contain about 3,900,000 tons grading 0.055 troy ounce of gold and 0.23 troy ounce of silver per ton.

The agreement, approved by the U.S. Department of Justice yesterday, will give the merged company, Baker Hughes, six months instead of three to sell certain assets.     The pact also allows a three-month extension, if warranted, and limits the obligation of the new company to give financial support to the businesses to be divested, pending their sale.     The company said its board recommended that shareholders approve the merger of the oilfield service companies. A previously adjourned meeting of Hughes Tool stockholders will be resumed this afternoon, it said.     "Hughes will work with Baker and the Justice Department towards negotiating the final form of the consent decree and filing it as soon as possible," the company said in a statement. Closing of the merger would occur immediately after the filing, it said.

The company noted its petition covering the product and its safety evaluation were submitted to the FDA last month.     While awaiting FDA approval, the company said, it is proceeding with plans for commercialization through its McNeil Specialty Products Co subsidiary.     Johnson and Johnson said it is operating under a licensing agreement with Tate and Lyle, whose collaborative research with scientists at Queen Elizabeth College in London led to the discovery of Sucralose in 1976.     Patents and licensing agreements control the use of sucralose through the year 2001, Johnson and Johnson said.     Sucralose is a chlorinated derivative of ordinary sugar. The carbon-chloride bonds in sucralose are stable and are not broken during digestion or metabolism.     Sucralose is essentially not metabollized by the body. The chlorine content enhances sweetness without providing calories.  Reuter &#3;

trade,money-fx,cpi,reserves	HUNGARY HOPES DEVALUATION WILL END TRADE DEFICIT .  National Bank of Hungary first vice-president Janos Fekete said he hoped a planned eight pct devaluation of the forint will spur exports and redress last year's severe trade deficit with the West.     Fekete told Reuters in an interview Hungary must achieve at least equilibrium on its hard currency trade.     "It is useful to have a devaluation," he said. "There is now a real push to our exports and a bit of a curb to our imports."     The official news agency MTI said today Hungary would devalue by eight pct and it expected the new rates to be announced later today. Fekete said the rates would come into effect tomorrow.     He said one reason for the devaluation was that Hungary had a higher rate of inflation over the past two years than its main partners (around eight pct in 1985 and between five and 5.5 pct in 1986).     This was partly an after-effect of action Hungary took to prevent inflation from soaring during the oil price shocks of the 1970s, he added.     Hungary devalued by a similar amount last September and by between three and four pct early last year.     But the country's hard currency trade balance nevertheless fell into a deficit of 539.4 mln dlrs from a surplus of 295.3 mln in 1986 and 1.2 billion in 1985.     Fekete said Hungary was hoping for a hard currency trade surplus of between 200 and 300 mln dlrs this year, but that a more likely outcome would be closer to equilibrium on total hard currency trade of around 10 billion dlrs.     One Western commercial attache here said: "Devaluation of itself will not change anything. It will only be useful if they also make efforts to restructure industry and improve the quality of their export goods."     Fekete said he hoped to raise credits on good terms this year to invest in restructuring industry.     It would be his role to persuade international banks to cooperate in this process. He noted Hungary had been given an AA rating enabling it to raise money on the Japanese Samurai bond market.     Hungary's net hard currency debt soared to 7.79 billion dlrs last year from 5.01 billion in 1985, partly because of a current account deficit of 1.42 billion dlrs and partly because the fall in the dollar increased the dollar value of debt denominated in marks or yen.     He said he feared net debt would also rise slightly this year, but he was in favour of borrowing for the purpose of modernisation.     "I am for credits to invest for that purpose," he said. "I am against credits for consumption." He forecast gross domestic product growth of two pct this year, from one pct in 1986.    Fekete said Hungary would continue to restructure its debt profile by prepaying high interest shorter and medium term loans with cheaper long term money for which it was looking more and more to the fixed interest rate bond market, where he considered rates to be low.     Hard currency foreign exchange reserves would stay at around 3.5 billion dlrs, he said. On the budget deficit, which tripled to a provisional 47 billion forints last year after quadrupling in 1985, Fekete said the finance ministry was working out measures to reduce an approved target deficit for this year of 43.8 billion forints to between 30 and 35 billion forints.

crude	ECUADOR DEPUTY MINISTER SEEKS OIL AID IN VENEZUELA .  Ecuador's deputy energy minister Fernando Santos Alvite arrived here last night for talks on further Venezuelan assistance to his country's oil industry following last week's earthquake, officials said.     Ecuador was obliged to suspend crude oil exports for an expected five months as a result of damage to 25 miles of pipeline linking its jungle oil fields with the Pacific port of Balao. Oil normally accounts for 60 pct of its exports.     Fellow OPEC member Venezuela has already agreed to lend Ecuador five mln barrels of crude, to be repaid in kind after 180 days, to help meet its domestic consumption needs.     The officials could neither confirm nor deny reports that Venezuela will temporarily produce Ecuador's entire OPEC quota, set at 210,000 barrels per day for first half 1987.     "All options are open at this moment in the context of cooperation on oil production," a Venezuelan energy and mines ministry source said.     Discussions are also under way to arrive at a formula to compensate Ecuador for the loss in oil export revenue while the pipeline is repaired, officials said.     Santos Alvite last night met Venezuelan energy and mines minister Arturo Hernandez Grisanti and will today hold talks at technical level, officials said.     Industry sources said that among the options are for Venezuela to produce Ecuador's entire quota, or for Venezuela and non-OPEC Mexico to share it and for the latter to supply Ecuador's Far Eastern clients.     But the ministry source said that no decision has yet been reached on the matter, and that an announcement would be made in due course.     Santos Alvite said earlier in Quito that Ecuador would have to import six to seven mln barrels of crude oil to meet its needs until the line was repaired.     Ecuador energy and mines minister Javier Espinosa Teran said last night his country needs 120 mln dlrs to repair the damage to the export pipeline caused by the earthquake.  REUTER &#3;

Finland's mining and metals group Outokumpu Oy &lt;OUTO.HE>, which last week reported a 1986 loss of 83 mln markka after three successive years of profits, said it restructured its key copper processing division in an attempt to rationalize production and improve profitability.     Outokumpu's Managing Director Pertti Voutilainen told a news conference the reorganization involved a split of the division into a new independent division with six profit centres.     Outokumpu group had a 1986 loss before appropriations and taxes of 83 mln markka after a profit of 355 mln in 1985. It had profits in 1984 and 1983 but a loss, 171.2 mln, in 1982.     Outokumpu acquired two Swedish copper manufacturers in January 1986, &lt;Metallverken Ab> and &lt;Wirsbo Bruks Ab>, that were merged into its copper processing division.     The division had a turnover of 3.2 billion markka last year, 42 pct of Outokumpu's group turnover of 7.58 billion.     The new Outokumpu division, called Copper Products Industry, is to incorporate Outokumpu's copper production plants, including its two U.S. Subsidiaries &lt;Nippert Co> and &lt;Valleycast Inc>, as well as Metallverken and part of Wirsbo.     Outokumpu is planning to make Wirsbo an independent division in the Outokumpu group and transfer only Wirsbo's copper tube production into one of the new division's profit centres. A definite decision on Wirsbo will be taken later this year.     The new division will have production plants in Finland, Sweden, Norway, the Netherlands and the U.S.  REUTER &#3;
bop,trade	U.S. TRADE DEFICIT 38.37 BILLION DLRS IN 4TH QTR .  The U.S. merchandise trade deficit on a balance of payments basis was a record 38.37 billion dlrs in the October to December fourth quarter, the Commerce Department said.     The record trade shortfall came after a revised 37.15 billion dlr third quarter deficit. The department previously reported the third quarter deficit was 37.67 billion dlrs.     For the full year 1986, the merchandise trade deficit was a record 147.7 billion dlrs, up from 124.4 billion dlrs in 1985, the department said.     During the final quarter last year imports rose 2.78 billion dlrs or three pct to 95.7 billion dlrs, while exports rose 1.56 billion dlrs or three pct to 57.33 billion dlrs.     The trade report on a balance of payments basis excludes such factors as military sales and the costs of shipping and insurance.     The Commerce Department said non-petroleum imports in the quarter were up 2.7 billion dlrs or three pct to 87.7 billion dlrs, with the largest increases in consumer goods, which rose 1.2 billion dlrs, and in non-monetary gold and passenger cars from Canada, up 900 mln dlrs each.     Lumber imports from Canada fell 300 mln dlrs or 33 pct because of a 15 pct duty on imports from Canada, the department said. Passenger car imports fell 600 mln dlrs because of an 18 pct decrease in the number of South Korean-made imported cars and a nine pct decrease from Japan.     On the exports side, agricultural exports rose 600 mln dlrs or nine pct to 7.1 billion dlrs, primarily because of a 104 pct or 600 mln dlr increase in soybean exports.     Soybean shipments to Western Europe rose sharply because supplies from Brazil, a traditional major exporter, were limited by drought.     Commerce said the U.S. trade deficit with Latin America rose 900 mln dlrs to 2.6 billion dlrs, with Japan increased 700 mln dlrs to 14.8 billion dlrs and with Western Europe rose 200 mln to 7.2 billion dlrs in the quarter.     The deficit with newly industrialized Far East countries, including Hong Kong, South Korea, Singapore and Taiwan, fell 500 mln dlrs to eight billion dlrs and with Canada the deficit decreased 200 mln dlrs to 3.3 billion dlrs in the quarter.     In the full year 1986, imports rose 30.6 billion dlrs or nine pct to 369.5 billion dlrs. Exports increased by only 7.3 billion dlrs or three pct to 221.8 billion dlrs.     Commerce said petroleum imports during 1986 fell 16.6 billion dlrs or 33 pct to 33.9 billion dlrs because of lower prices. The average price per barrel decreased to 14.72 dlrs from 26.41 dlrs.     Agricultural exports fell by 2.6 billion dlrs or nine pct to 26.9 billion during the year. The average price of rice fell 27 pct, cotton was down 22 pct, corn 18 pct, wheat 16 pct and soybeans nine pct.     The trade deficit with Japan for all of 1986 rose 11.1 billion dlrs to 54.6 billion dlrs and with Western Europe increased 7.2 billion dlrs to 28.6 billion dlrs.  Reuter &#3;

Danish-based insulin and enzymes producer Novo Industri A/S (NVO.CO) said pre-tax earnings fell almost 10 pct in 1986 though sales rose by two pct.     The pre-tax figure fell to 788 mln crowns from 872 mln in 1985, on sales increased from 4.1 billion to 4.2 billion, giving net earnings of 521 mln crowns against 604 mln in 1985.     Earnings per 20-crown share went from 23.79 crowns to 20.45 crowns but the company proposed an unchanged 20 pct dividend.     "Foreign exchange fluctuations in 1986 were a very significant factor behind developments in the result before and after tax," Novo said in a statement.     "Not only the U.S. Dollar but also other currencies essential to Novo fell in 1986 in relation to the Danish crown," the statement added.     In November 1986, Novo purchased 75 pct of shares in A/S Ferrosan, which heads a group specialising in research and development of CNS (central nervous treatment) treatments and the sale of pharmaceuticals and vitamins in Scandinavia.

acq	CHRYSLER &lt;C> DEAL LEAVES UNCERTAINTY FOR AMC WORKERS .  Chrysler Corp's 1.5 billion dlr bid to takeover American Motors Corp &lt;AMO> should help bolster the small automaker's sales, but it leaves the future of its 19,000 employees in doubt, industry analysts say.     It was "business as usual" yesterday at the American Motors headquarters, one day after the proposed merger was unveiled by Chrysler and AMC's French parent Renault, according to company spokesman Edd Snyder.     But AMC's future, to be discussed at a board meeting today, would be radically different as a Chrysler subsidiary than if it had continued with the state-run French car group as its controlling shareholder.     Industry analysts said the future of AMC's car assembly plant in Kenosha, Wis., and its Toledo, Ohio, Jeep plant would be in doubt if the overcapacity predicted in the North American auto industry by the early 1990s comes to pass.     Both plants are far from "state of the art" for car manufacturing sites, and AMC has a history of poor labor relations at each.     "Chrysler doesn't need that many new plants," said Michael Luckey, automotive analyst for the Wall Street firm Shearson Lehman Brothers. "They probably will close the Toledo plant and move Jeep production to Canada."     Ronald Glantz of Montgomery Securities said that at the very least, the new owner of the Toledo plant would be able to wring concessions from the United Automobile Workers union local representing Jeep workers.     "The UAW won't be able to hold them up for ransom as they have AMC because during a down year, Chrysler will have underutilized facilities to transfer production," he said.     Analysts said they foresaw no major complications that would abort a combination which historians said would be the auto industry's biggest merger since American Motors was formed in 1954.     AMC was in need of a financial savior because of its losses of more than 800 mln dlrs since 1980 and pressures in France for Renault to cut its backing. The company had said it could not forecast consistent profitability until 1988 at the earliest.     In announcing the takeover agreement, Chrysler chairman Lee Iacocca cited AMC's Jeep division as well as its new 675 mln dlr assembly plant at Bramalea, Ontario, and its network of 1,200 dealers as the major attractions.     Analysts reasoned that Chrysler might feel moved eventually to sell off or close some of the older plants to cut overhead costs in view of the new debts and liabilities it would incur in the AMC buyout.

gold,silver	ST. JOE GOLD TO DEVELOP ONTARIO MINE .  St. Joe Gold Corp said it plans to proceed with development of its Golden Patricia gold property in northwestern Ontario.     It said about five mln dlrs will be spent to continue underground development and obtain operating permits and another 10.2 mln dlrs is expected to be required to complete underground development, construct a mill and provide the infrastructure needed to put the mine into commercial production.     St. Joe Gold said if the necessary operating permits were granted in time, it would start gold production in the second half of the year ending October 31, 1988 at an annual rate of about 40,000 troy ounces.     The company said the property is estimated to contain over 500,000 troy ounces of gold, and the initial mining project covers only seven of 192 claims, with drill-indicated reserves of 293,000 short tons grading 0.88 troy ounce of gold per ton.     It said initial mine output is expected to be about 150 tons of ore daily.     St. Joe Gold said the Golden Patricia vein has not been tested at depth or along strike to the east and west and exploration is continuing on the Golden Patricia property and the adjacent wholly-owned Muskeg Lake property.     The company also said its Richmond Hill gold and silver deposit in the Carbonate district of western South Dakota has been shown by drilling to contain about 3,900,000 tons grading 0.055 troy ounce of gold and 0.23 troy ounce of silver per ton.  It said preliminary results are encouraging and a feasibility study is nearing completion.  Reuter &#3;

"I am very impressed with the strong basic earnings story," analyst Smith said, noting that the company has "fine tuned its buying and inventories, and has admirably controlled costs in a time that they needed to."     The stock jumped 2-1/2 to 98-3/4.     Smith said the company ended 1986 with a strong cash position of about 639 mln dlrs as compared to 158 mln dlrs the year before. "This implies the possibility of a share buyback, or significant dividend increase or a stock split," he said.     In addition, he said the company has been gradually adjusting its merchandise mix and its gross margins have been improving.     Smith expects the company to earn 8.25-to-8.50 dlrs a share in 1987 as compared to the 7.06 dlrs a share earned last year. Last year's results include a 69 cent charge for the buyback of debt.

A European Commission spokesman in Brussels earlier confirmed that one mln tonnes of sugar had been offered to intervention boards in various member states.

Sigma said it changed its 1986 reserve reporting method following Dome Mines' previously reported move to adopt general industry practice of reporting proven and probable ore reserves.     Prior to 1986, Sigma conservatively reported only proven reserves that could be mined without future development costs.

acq	U.S. JUSTICE DEPARTMENT REVIEWS ICAHN USAIR FILING .  The U.S. Department of Justice (DOJ) is reviewing whether Trans World Airlines Inc &lt;TWA> and Chairman Carl Icahn violated federal antitrust law by failing to seek advance clearance from the DOJ or the Federal Trade Commission for his extensive open-market purchases of USAir Group Inc &lt;U> stock, a DOJ official told a Senate panel.     "This is a matter that is being looked into," Charles Rule, acting assistant attorney general-antitrust, told the Senate Judiciary Committee's Antitrust Subcommittee.     Rule declined further comment while the review was continuing.     Rule was responding to panel Chairman Howard Metzenbaum (D-Ohio), who had asked why the department was not acting against "what appears to be a clear violation of the law."     Metzenbaum said Icahn had failed to file a pre-merger notification form with the FTC prior to purchasing more than 15 mln dlrs' worth of USAir stock.     But Rule said that, for airline companies, a purchaser would be exempt from the requirement if it instead had filed a merger application with the U.S. Department of Transportation.     Icahn filed such an application with the DOT, but the filing was thrown out by the DOT on Friday.     The DOT threw out the application late Friday on grounds it lacked the necessary data for the government to review the proposed USAir takeover bid.     Icahn refiled a more complete application form Monday.     Rule pledged to act against Icahn and TWA if a violation were found.  Reuter &#3;

"Good domestic demand, higher operating earnings and a strng export business, probably benefitting from a lower dollar and effects of reduced imports in chemicals will continue to aid Du Pont." He also noted that energy earnings in the first quarter are better than expected because of the rise in crude prices. Semegran expects first quarter earnings of about 1.85 dlrs a share from 1.67 dlrs last year.

The conference, which began Monday, is widely seen as the final effort to adopt a new International Natural Rubber Agreement (INRA) before the current one expires in October.     Some 40 producing and consuming countries are taking part in the two-week meeting. This is the fourth such conference in nearly two years.     Delegates said both sides still appeared divided on the key issue of the price adjustment mechanism.     Consumers want frequent price reviews at 12 month intervals instead of 18 months as at present, a proposal currently rejected by producers.     And while consumers press for the price adjustment to be automatic, producers have resisted reducing the role of the International Rubber Organization Council in the price adjustment procedure.

interest	NATIONAL SAVINGS MOVE POINTS TO LOWER U.K. RATES .  U.K. Interest rates look set to move lower even after Monday's half-point cut in bank base rates to 10-1/2 pct, analysts said, citing as evidence the suspension of a British National Savings issue yesterday.     The Department of National Savings, effectively a Treasury Department unit, yesterday suspended its 32nd issue, launched in October and paying a high tax-free 8-3/4 pct on five-year private investments between 25 and 5,000 stg. A spokesman said the suspension was just a reaction to yields on national savings bonds being way out of line with the rest of the market.     The move was followed by a surprise sell-out within minutes today of a Bank of England one-billion stg tap issue, the second such issue in as many weeks, analysts noted.     They said the near-instant sale of the entire new gilts issue, for which the Bank of England had required a high 40 pct downpayment, was clear evidence that the market thought rates had to drop sooner rather than later.     The sale of the tranche of 8-3/4 pct treasury bonds due 1997 occurred in an active, bullish gilts market as downward pressure on money market rates remained intact, with the bellwether three-month interbank rate down 1/8 point at 10-9-7/8 pct.      It coincided with another strong sterling rally which pushed the pound to four-year highs against the dollar.     "That government stock disappeared very quickly indeed," said Stephen Lewis, head of economic research at stockbrokers Phillips and Drew; "It is an indication that the market believes rates are going to fall further ... At least by a half-point immediately after the budget (on March 17), and some people hope for more."     Stockbrokers James Capel said in a comment the move by the National Savings Department was "of considerable significance."     It said, "the real message ... Is that the decks are being quickly cleared so as to facilitate a speedy decision by the building societies to cut their rates when the inevitable cut in bank base rates to 10 pct materialises."     Building societies have said a drop in bank base rates would normally have to exceed half a point to give rise to a reduction in mortgage lending rates.     Lewis of Phillips and Drew said he too believed the National Savings issue suspension may reflect new U.K. Treasury policy to point building societies towards a mortgage rate cut.     "National Savings has been competing too effectively with the building societies of late. Building society income has been depressed in recent months," he said.     He and other analysts said Chancellor of the Exchequer Nigel Lawson was keen to see mortgage rates fall to keep a lid on U.K. Inflation.     Underlying upward pressure on prices is stronger in Britain than in most other Western economies with inflation seen rising well above four pct this year and above five pct in 1988 after last year's 3.7 pct.     Emphasising the impact of mortgage rates on consumer prices, Lewis said a one-point cut in building society rates would reduce inflation in Britain by about 0.4 pct.     But Lewis and others noted that building societies had been complaining to the government about intense competition from National Savings, which they argued reduced the scope for early mortgage rate cuts.     "The Chancellor need not be worried about losing some PSBR funding from National Savings, but he must be taking the building societies' criticism to heart. It looks like the National Savings move reflects this," one senior dealer said.     A Savings Department spokesman refused to comment on this interpretation, saying the suspension of the issue was merely a reaction to the recent fall in U.K. Interest rates, which had pushed yields on national savings bonds way out of line with the rest of the market.     "We are not politically motivated ... Funding was just becoming too expensive and we don't need all that money," he told Reuters, adding the department had suspended issues at least twice in the past, when offered interest rates were above or below market rates.     He said demand for the issue had risen sharply of late as U.K. Money market rates continued their steady decline and income was threatening to overshoot an unofficial three billion stg target set for fiscal 1986 ending March 31.     In the first 10 months of fiscal 1986, National Saving's contribution to government funding totalled 2.72 billion stg, compared with 2.01 billion stg in the same period of the previous year, official figures show.     Figures for February, out on Monday, are expected to show a further increase of between 300 and 400 mln stg, pushing the total for 11 months above target, government officials said.  REUTER &#3;

acq	BELGIAN MINISTER UNVEILS PRIVATISATION PLAN .  Belgian Budget Minister Guy Verhofstadt has proposed a plan to sell off shares in several state-owned enterprises, including national airline Sabena and the postal and telecommunications authority, government sources said.     They said the plan could raise more than 25 billion francs in revenue over the next five years according to Verhofstadt's projections, helping the government to reduce its huge budget deficit, targetted this year at 418 billion francs.     But the scheme had received a guarded reception from the Social Christian parties in Belgium's centre-right coalition when Verhofstadt unveiled it at a cabinet meeting yesterday.     Discussion of the plan was likely to be long and difficult, the sources said.     Verhofstadt proposes beginning the selloffs in the last quarter of 1987, with the sale of 30 to 40 pct of state investment company SNI. He expects the sale to raise three billion francs, they added.     A 25 pct share in Sabena would be sold in mid-1989 for 1.5 billion francs, while 50 pct of the postal and telecommunications authority would be sold off in two stages in mid-1990 and early 1992, raising at least seven billion francs.     Also on Verhofstadt's list are the Maritime Transport Authority, leading gas distributor Distrigaz, CGER savings bank, CGER, and several other credit institutions.

sugar	LICHT SEES STAGNANT EUROPEAN BEET AREA .  The overall area devoted to sugar beet in Europe is forecast to remain stagnant this year at 7.22 mln hectares compared with 7.21 mln ha in 1986, West German statistician F.O. Licht said.     It was feared that the recent steep rise in sugar prices would have a marked effect on planting intentions this year, Licht said, but judging by this first estimate the effect was probably minimal.     The total beet area in the European Community is forecast to fall two pct to 1.85 mln ha against 1.89 mln in 1986.     The total Western Europe area is put at 2.49 mln ha, against 2.50 mln in 1986. Eastern Europe area is forecast at 4.73 mln ha against 4.72 mln.     Individual West Europe country estimates, in 1,000 hectares (with 1986 figures in brackets), are, Belgium/Luxembourg 114 (118), Denmark 69 (69), France 419 (421), Greece 35 (44), Ireland 36 (38), Italy 270 (275), Netherlands 129 (138), Portugal 1 (1), Spain 192 (190), U.K. 200 (201), West Germany 385 (399), Austria 32 (28), Finland 30 (31), Sweden 51 (52), Switzerland 15 (14), Turkey 355 (340), Yugoslavia 160 (136).     Eastern Europe plantings are forecast as follows, USSR 3400 (3440), Albania 10 (9), Bulgaria 52 (50), Czechoslovakia 195 (196), East Germany 210 (205), Hungary 108 (96), Poland 460 (440), Romania 295 (280).     On the basis of average yields this year, Licht said these area forecasts pointed to a total European beet sugar crop in 1987/88 of 29.8 mln tonnes, raw value, down from 31.4 mln tonnes in 1986/87. Licht said sugar yields were fairly high last season, thanks to favourable weather, and this increases the chances of a significant reduction in production in 1987/88.     Based on average yields, EC beet sugar production could fall nearly 10 pct this year to 13.5 mln tonnes from 14.9 mln in 1986/87, while total Western Europe production could be 16.9 mln tonnes against 18.1 mln. Eastern Europe production could be 12.9 mln tonnes against 13.3 mln in 1986/87.  Reuter &#3;

Meese told the House Appropriations Subcommittee that consideration would be part of the Justice Department's review of the proposed merger.

In a filing with the Securities and Exchange Commission, Sosnoff, a New York investor and money manager, said the offers to buy back his stock occurred "on several occasions during the past year."     The offers were made by several Caesars World representatives, including its chairman, Henry Gluck, he said.     Sosnoff said he rejected all of the proposals.     The Caesars World official suggested various forms of payment for Sosnoff's stake, including other securities of the company and cash, he said. Sosnoff did not detail the value of the proposed compensation.     Also suggested was a deal involving "put" and "call" option regarding Sosnoff's Caesars World holdings, he said.     The proposed deals would have also included a "standstill" agreement, which would have restricted Sosnoff's right to buy more Caesars World stock or "to take any action adverse to incumbent management," he said.     Sosnoff's report on the offers he received for his Caesars World shares were amended to his official offer to purchase the company, as well as reported to the SEC.     Sosnoff now holds about 4.1 mln Caesars World shares, or 13.6 pct of the company's 30 mln shares outstanding.     The Sosnoff offer to buy the shares of the company he does not already hold has been valued at 725.2 mln dlrs.  Reuter &#3;
crude,nat-gas	ENERGY/FOREIGN INVESTORS .  Lured by the weakening dollar and the conviction that oil prices are poised for a rebound, European energy companies are buying up cheap U.S. oil and gas reserves to replenish their supplies, oil industry analysts said.     They said owning oil reserves in a politically stable United States is good insurance against future shortages. However, the quick pace of foreign investment has heated up competition among European firms, well-heeled U.S. institutional investors and major oil companies to snare choice domestic oil properties.     Strevig and Associates, a Houston firm that tracks oil and gas reserve sales, said growing interest among foreign buyers had helped push reserve prices in recent months higher. All buyers of U.S. reserves paid a median price of 6.45 dlrs a barrel of oil during the fourth quarter of 1986 for acquisitions, up from 5.33 dlrs in the third quarter and five dlrs in the second quarter, according to the firm's research.     "Foreign investors have been here nibbling a long time, but we're seeing new names and smaller companies coming in," said Arthur Smith, an oil property appraisal specialist and president of John S. Herold Inc in Greenwich, Conn.     "Europeans, especially, do not have much indigenous oil and gas and realize the tide will eventually turn in favor of the Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries," he added.     Smith and other oil industry analyst and economists believe the trend in foreign investments will continue in 1987 because of the fall in value of the U.S. dollar, the perception that oil prices have hit bottom and the fact that it is cheaper to buy new reserves than to explore for them.     Plenty of properties are available on the market, thanks to the need of many companies to raise cash for debt payments and general restructuring throughout the oilpatch.     In two of the biggest transactions of recent months, French-owned Minatome Corp., a unit of &lt;Total Compagnie Francaise des Petroles>, spent more than 230 mln dlrs to separately acquire oil assets of Texas International &lt;TEICC> and Lear Petroleum Partners &lt;LPP>. A spokesman for Minatome said the company is searching for additional acquisitions.     A partnership of two Belgian-owned firms, &lt;Petrofina S.A.> and &lt;Cometra Oil S.A.> paid 150 mln dlrs late last year to buy virtually all the exploration assets of the Williams Cos &lt;WMB>, the Oklahoma pipeline firm.     But Japanese investors prefer entering into joint ventures with experienced U.S. companies to explore for new oil. Japan's &lt;Nippon Oil> is a partner of Texaco Inc's &lt;TX> Texaco USA in a 100 mln dlrs U.S. drilling program, and has joined with Dupont's &lt;DD> Conoco Inc in a similar 135 dlrs mln deal.     Most buyers said the pay-back period of a property, its geographic location and the lifting cost of the crude oil are more important factors in evaluating potential acquisitions than relying on a simple price-per-barrel formula.     Rich Hodges, a Houston-based land manager representing International Oil and Gas Corp, a partnership of &lt;Preussag Corp> and &lt;C. Deilmann Inc> of West Germany, said the firm had earmarked at least 50 mln dlrs to spend on oil reserves in Texas, Oklahoma or Louisiana in the coming months.     But he called that a small amount compared to the amount other investors have for acquisitions. PaineWebber's Geodyne Energy Income Fund, for example, has said it plans to spend up to 300 mln dlrs on oil and gas properties.     "The competition is stiff, not only from other foreign investors but from the brokerage houses and U.S. oil companies," he said. "Our company is shopping around because we feel it's substantially less risky than pure exploration. If you're going to take the risk inherent in exploration, you need prices higher than the current market," he added.     In addition to the foreign investors and U.S. brokerage houses, analysts said many of the major oil companies were also competing for prime properties.     Houston-based Shell Oil Co, a unit of Royal Dutch/Shell Group &lt;RD>, has been one of the most active companies in buying and selling reserves, Smith said. Since 1982, Shell has acquired two billion dlrs in new reserves, including 470 mln barrels of oil equivalent at a net cost of 2.80 dlrs a barrel, he said.     "Buying reserves is a good strategy for most of these companies," Smith said. "Domestic production has dropped by one mln barrels a day because of cutbacks in drilling and it may drop by another one mln barrels a day in 1988."  Reuter &#3;
gnp	AUSTRIAN 1987 GROWTH SEEN BETWEEN 0.5 AND 1.5 PCT .  A meeting of leading politicians, bankers and economists has forecast Austrian real gross domestic product growth for this year at between 0.5 and 1.5 pct, a government spokesman said.     This compared with a two pct growth forecast made by the semi-official Institute for Economic Research (WIFO) last December.     Helmut Kramer, spokesman for Chancellor Franz Vranitzky, told Reuters that the forecast had been made during the meeting attended by Vranitzky, Finance Minister Ferdinand Lacina, National Bank President Stefan Koren and a WIFO representative.     Economists have been cutting growth forecasts recently mainly due to expectations of a poor export performance this year, notably to Eastern Europe and oil exporting states.

Two major U.K. Clearing banks announced they will offer a total of 800 mln stg in new mortgages at a fixed interest rate of 10.2 pct for the first three years, below current bank base lending rates of 10.5 pct.     Midland Bank Plc &lt;MDBL.L> said it has initially allocated 500 mln stg for home loans at this rate, while Lloyds Bank Plc &lt;LLOY.L> will offer 300 mln stg.     Earlier this week, Midland said it would cut its standard rate of mortgage payment to 11.5 pct from April 1, following a half a percentage point reduction in leading banks' base lending rates from 11 pct.     Building society and other bank mortgage rates are largely still well above the new base rate level, although last year Lloyds offered a fixed rate of 9.9 pct on certain home loans.     A Midland spokesman said his bank calculated that at the current level of 2.7 billion stg, its existing mortgage book accounts for about 5 pct of the total British home loan market.

grain,corn	DOLE SAYS 0/92 OPTION SHOULD BE CONSIDERED .  U.S. Senate Republican leader Robert Dole said Congress should consider legislation to apply the so-called 0/92 option to producers of major commodities.     Dole told the National Corn Growers Association that he thought the proposal, supported by the Reagan administration, "should be seriously considered" because a refusal to do so could "play into the hands of those who want mandatory controls" placed on production.     However, Dole did not say whether he would support the 0/92 option, which would offer producers at least 92 pct of their income support payments regardless of how much they planted.     The Senate Republican leader said the 0/92 option posed two problems. First, it is viewed, he said, by some as welfare. In addition, debate on the proposal could open up the whole farm bill, Dole said.     Dole also repeated his call for an across-the-board export enhancement program, saying a subsidy offer to the Soviet Union could help improve U.S. relations with that country.     Dole said that the United States has made the decision to trade with Moscow and that it's important to offer competitive prices.     The senator predicted Congress would have to decide this year whether to require an expansion of the export subsidy program, which currently targets benefits to recapture markets lost to other suppliers which subsidize.     Dole, who last year pledged to offer legislation to require a marketing loan for major crops but never did so, again called for the marketing loan for wheat and feedgrains.     The Reagan administration's proposed farm policy changes "are not going anywhere" this year, Dole said, singling out the proposal to cut target prices 10 pct per year.     Asked by reporters after his speech whether he sensed a shift in the State Department towards supporting an export enhancement initiative for the Soviet Union, Dole said he didn't see any change.     Dole also said it would be a very close call in the Senate whether to open up the farm bill to general debate this year.     Dole said he was encouraged by the selection of Republican David Karnes to replace the late Sen. Edward Zorinsky (D-Neb.)  Reuter &#3;

U.S. Senate Republican leader Robert Dole (R-Kan.) said he and a group of Republican lawmakers are considering introducing legislation to extend the ethanol tax exemption through the year 2000.     Dole, addressing the National Corn Growers Association board, said the proposal was under consideration by a rural task force of Republican members of Congress and governors.     Gasoline containing at least 10 pct ethanol now receives a six cents per gallon exemption from a nine cent federal excise tax. The exemption is to expire the end of 1992.     Ethanol is produced primarily by a few large agribusiness firms including Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) and A.E. Staley. The tax exemption has helped bolster ethanol production despite a sharp drop in the prices of competing crude oil.  Reuter &#3;

Maoist guerrillas using dynamite derailed two locomotives and four train wagons, interrupting traffic on Peru's sole railway line linking the capital to the central Andes, where most of the country's mining centres are located, authorities said.     Damages was estimated at 800,000 dlrs in the dynamite blast yesterday at Chacapalca, where the explosion wrecked the train laden with minerals and 45 metres of the railway line.     Crews hoped to restore traffic to the line later today after clearing the damaged train and repairing the tracks at Chacapalca, 225 km east of the Capital, Lima.     An official at Mineroperu comercial (Minpeco), Peru's state minerals marketing firm, said the agency was assessing the situation. There had not been a declaration of force majeure on contracts to ship minerals abroad.     Foreign sales of silver, copper, zinc and other minerals earn Peru over half of its export income. Most of the minerals, extracted and refined in the central peruvian andes, are shipped down the central railway to the lima port of callao.  Reuter &#3;
acq	WALL STREET STOCKS/TENNECO INC &lt;TGT> .  Tenneco Inc, a company that has long been rumored to be a takeover candidate, rose sharply today when speculation surfaced that investor T. Boone Pickens may be targeting the company for an acquisition, traders and analysts said.     Tenneco spokesman Joseph Macrum said "we have no comment to make whatsoever." Pickens was not available for comment.     Traders noted that activity in the stock increased today after a published report linked Pickens to Tenneco.     Tenneco rose two points to 48-3/4.     Paul Feretti, an analyst with New Orleans-based Howard, Weil, Labouisse, Friedrichs, Inc, said he was not surprised at market rumors that Tenneco might be the target of a takeover attempt.     "It's pure market speculation that Boone Pickens and his group may be interested," Feretti said.     "But Tenneco would be a challenge to run because of its sheer size and diversity. Mr. Pickens is a man who likes a challenge."     Pickens, who made an unsuccessful attempt to take over Dallas-based Diamond Shamrock Corp &lt;DIA> last winter, has made no secret of his plans to acquire additional natural gas reserves in the belief that gas prices will stabilize sooner than oil prices. Tenneco holds natural gas reserves estimated in excess of 3.5 trillion cubic feet, analysts said.     Feretti conservatively estimated Tenneco's breakup value at 58 dlrs a share and said the company generated a cash flow of about 10 dlrs a share "which is probably very attractive to Pickens." Other analysts, however, estimate a breakup value well into the 60 dlr a share range.     "I strongly doubt that there is going to be any hostile takeover," Drexel Burnham Lambert Inc's Houston-based analyst John Olson said, putting little credence in the rumors.     "Tenneco is a gargantuan enterprise with seven billion dlrs in long-term debt and preferred stock outstanding." He said the buyer would also have to deal with "the intractable problems" Tenneco faces with its farm equipment unit and energy businesses.     Analysts suggested that Tenneco could use a number of defensive strategies to fend off an unwanted buyer, such as spin off some of its non-energy businesses directly to shareholders, buy back shares or create a limited partnership out of its natural gas pipeline interests.     An analyst who asked to remain unidentified, discouraged the Pickens rumor. "Pickens has a plateful already with his holdings in Burlington Northern and Amerada Hess," he said. "I don't think he would be willing to take on Tenneco's problems with Case (the farm equipment unit), which has been losing about 180 mln dlrs annually and is worth less than a billion dlrs on the market today."

The transaction is subject to regulatory approval and a vote by Equity minority shareholders at the April 23 annual meeting, the company said.     Proceeds from sale of the shares, priced at 5.625 dlrs each, will be used to buy and deliver 4,985,000 ounces of silver to Placer, Equity said.     Equity Silver said the silver remains to be delivered under its sale agreement with Placer, after delivery of its 750,000 ounce minimum commitment for 1987.     Equity said it arranged to acquire 4,985,000 ounces of silver at 7.40 dlrs an ounces, subject to selling the shares to Placer.     Purchase and delivery of the silver to Placer will result in an after-tax gain of about 6.6 mln dlrs, Equity said.     It also said the stock and silver transactions will create a 37,059,000 dlr fund out of which dividends will be paid when cash is available.     The cash fund will enable Equity Silver to continue to pay dividends on its preferred shares and increase the likelihood that it may be able to pay dividends on its common shares, the company said.     It did not elaborate on what common share dividends might be paid.     The company normally pays quarterly preferred dividends totalling 619,000 dlrs from retained earnings, Equity Silver said.

crude,ship	BRAZIL'S SARNEY MEETS STRIKES WITH SHOW OF FORCE .  With troops in place in Brazil's ports and oil installations, the government of Prersident Jose Sarney today sought to end a wave of labour unrest by a show of force.     Yesterday the government sent thousands of troops supported in some instances by tanks to occupy nine oil refineries and six areas of oil production.     The state-oil company Petrobras requested the intervention because of a threatened strike by 55,000 oil industry employees.     The government had already dispatched more than 1,000 marines to occupy the country's main ports after a national seamen's strike was ruled illegal last Friday.     The strike by 40,000 seamen, now in its 13th day, represents a stern challenge to the government.     The stoppage has delayed exports at a time when Brazil desperately needs foreign exchange.     It was a deterioration in the country's trade balance which precipitated Brazil's current debt crisis and the decision on February 20 to suspend interest payments on 68 billion dlrs of commercial debt.     There was no sign today of an early end to the seamen's strike, which has badly hit the port of Santos -- the most important in South America -- and the country's other main ports.     Small groups of marines armed with submachineguns stand on the quays near the strike-bound ships, but the military presence here is generally discreet.     A total of 800 marines are inside the docks but most are out of sight.     Yesterday marines and police occupied one ship, the Docemarte, seamen's leaders said. After explaining to the captain that the strikers faced up to one year in jail because the strike was illegal, the men returned to work.     One of the strike leaders, Elmano Barbosa, said "it is a psychological war. They are using force and we are using peaceful methods."     Port sources said only two Brazilian ships in Santos, the Docemarte and the Henrique Leal, were working.     At the seamen's national strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, spokesmen say a total of about 190 ships are strike-bound in Brazil and in foreign ports.     Contradicting earlier reports from strike headquarters in Rio de Janeiro, seamen in Santos said the strikers on board ships here were not running out of food.     The current labour unrest is the worst faced by Sarney's civilian government since it came to power two years ago.     Yesterday, in a separate protest, hundreds of thousands of farmers held rallies directed largely against high bank interest rates.     The current rash of labour unrest in industry and agriculture stems from the failure of the government's now-collapsed Cruzado Plan price freeze.  Reuter &#3;

trade	SOUTH KOREA TO KEEP TRADE SURPLUS 3-5 YEARS .  South Korean Trade Minister Rha Woong Bae said his nation would maintain a trading surplus for three to five years as a way to cut its foreign debt.     He said in an interview with Reuter that after a few years it was likely South Korea would drop barriers to foreign goods and move toward a more balanced trade position.     He said the present trade surplus was vital if his nation was to reduce its 44.5 billion dlr foreign debt.     Rha said that 1986 was the first year South Korea had a trade surplus - 4.5 billion dlrs, against a 1985 deficit of  900 mln dlrs.     Rha made his remarks at the end of a two-week trade mission here during which a team he led agreed to buy U.S. products valued at 1.8 billion dlrs.     About 800 mln dlrs of the purchases here were in goods of the type South Korea normally bought from Japan.     Rha leaves today for Ottawa for trade talks with Canadian officials and businessmen.     Asked if South Korea would retaliate against U.S. goods if Congress closed U.S. markets to its products, he said "at this moment, we have no thought of retaliation."

The cabinet authorized energy and mines minister arturo hernandez grisanti to approve the purchase in the shareholders assembly of the state oil company petroleos de venezuela (pdvsa).     Pdvsa last april 14 signed a letter of intent to buy a half interest in champlin's corpus christi refinery for an undisclosed sum.     Under the terms of the provisional agreement, venezuela would supply up to 160,000 barrels a day to the plant through a new company which would be jointly owned by the pdvsa and champlin, a subsidiary of the union pacific corp &lt;unp>.     The deal would also allow pdvsa a joint share in champlin's refinery and distribution network.     The purhcase is one of a series of overseas joint ventures by which venezuela has managed to assure markets for some 400,000 barrels of its approximately 1.5 mln bpd exports.     Hernandez grisanti told reporters after the cabinet meeting that pdvsa will pay 93 mln dlrs for its half ownership in the champlin refinery - 33 mln dlrs in cash and 60 mln dlrs crude oil and products.     Through the deal, he said, venezuela will be assured the sale of at least 140,000 bpd of crude and products.

However, that company was later sold to a buyout group that topped the Hafts.

About 800 mln dlrs of the purchases are in goods of the type South Korea normally bought from Japan.     Rha was to leave later today for Ottawa for trade talks with Canadian officials and businessmen.     He said in the interview the U.S. purchases were to reduce his country's 7.1 billion dlr surplus with the United States and also to cut its 5.6 billion dlr shortfall with Japan.     Rha said it was also due to a shift in exchange rates between the U.S. dollar and the yen that made it cheaper to buy U.S. goods than Japanese goods.     He said South Korea heavily relied on foreign trade and he hoped the leaders of major trading nations could find a way to resolve the growing trend toward protectionist legislation.     Rha said "I hope the leaders can get together to find a solution by making some mutually satisfactory concessions."     But he added "the leaders seem hesitant to make concessions because of domestic political reasons."     Speaking of his own country, he said "We have made a lot of concessions already."     He cited regulations permitting foreign investment in industrial firms, allowing increased foreign banking activity and cracking down on piracy of intellectual property by strengthening protection of copyrights and patents.     Rha said South Korea had also lowered many of its tariffs.     Asked if South Korea would retaliate against U.S. goods if Congress closed U.S. markets to its products, he said "at this moment, we have no thought of retaliation."

lumber,plywood	OREGON LUMBER COMPANY TO SELL WOOD TO IRAQ .  A Portland-based wood products company has signed a 13 mln dlr contract with the Iraqi government to supply finished softwood lumber to Iraq, Edward Niedermeyer, president of Niedermeyer-Martin Co said yesterday.     Niedermeyer told the House Foreign Affairs sub-committee on International Economic Policy and Trade in Washington that the sales agreement contains an option that could make lumber exported worth more than 20 mln dlrs.     The delivery of about 8.0 mln dlrs worth of plywood, in addition to lumber, hinges on whether the U.S. Department of Agriculture will interpret plywood as an agricultural commodity under the credit guarantee program, he said.     Niedermeyer said the government export credit guarantee program (GSM-102) administered by the USDA was the key to opening the Iraqi market which up to now had been captured by Scandinavian lumber producers.     "This is the first time we have been able to sell wood products in Iraq, he said. Without the USDA program it would not have been possible. We hope this will lead to a long term export market for U.S. lumber products."     He said the contract calls for supplying 21 mln board feet to 30 mln board feet of softwood lumber for housing, construction and furniture manufacturing. He estimated the profit potential for his company on the sale at five to six pct.     Niedermeyer spent two weeks in Baghdad negotiating the sale late last month and early March. He is a member of the United States-Iraq Business Forum, a non-profit group designed to promote commerce with Iraq.     The forum members include Westinghouse and General Electric, but Niedermeyer's company is the only wood products firm on the membership roster.  Reuter &#3;

The recent purchase of 1.5 mln tonnes of U.S. corn by Japan and 600,000 tonnes by South Korea suggests that the two countries' demand for reliable supplies of corn is increasing, the U.S. Agriculture Department said.     In its World Production and Trade Report, the department said that view is reinforced by the expectation of a decline in exportable supplies of Argentine corn and uncertainty over the availability of South African and Chinese corn.     With these corn purchases, Japan is committed to buying 7.7 mln tonnes of U.S. corn in 1986/87 (Sept-Aug), nearly 400,000 tonnes greater than year-ago figures to date.

coffee,ship	BRAZIL COFFEE EXPORTS DISRUPTED BY STRIKE .  An 11-day-old strike by Brazilian seamen is affecting coffee shipments and could lead to a short term supply squeeze abroad, exporters said.     They could not quantify how much coffee has been delayed but said at least 40 pct of coffee exports are carried by Brazilian ships and movement of foreign vessels has also been disrupted by port congestion caused by the strike.     A series of labor disputes and bad weather has meant Brazil's coffee exports have been running at an average two weeks behind schedule since the start of the year, one source added.     By the end of February shipments had fallen 800,000 bags behind registrations, leaving around 2.4 mln bags to be shipped during March. By March 10 only 230,000 bags had been shipped, the sources said.     Given Brazil's port loading capacity of around 100,000 bags a day, even if normal operations were resumed immediately and not interrupted by bad weather, some March registered coffee will inevitably be shipped during April, they added.

Alcoa officials acknowledged the possibility that they may have a position in the off-exchange aluminum options market, but declined specific comment on trade speculation that the company is holding a large outstanding position.

But when you're dealing in un-alloyed ingot, it's a commodity business where there are a lot of tools available (for hedging) and Alcoa is using all of those tools," said Al Posti, Alcoa's manager of corporate news.

However, some New York-based aluminium traders said they believe the size of Alcoa's position has been exaggerated.     The possibility that Alcoa may be long call options is one factor indicating that supply tightness may worsen in the second quarter, traders said.     "If they decide to exercise their right to buy, it would mean really squeezing the market," one New York trader said, noting that aluminum stocks on the London Metal Exchange were 90,500 tonnes at the end of last week.

The senior Republican on the U.S. Senate Agriculture Committee, Richard Lugar of Indiana, called for repeal of the cargo preference law that aids the American shipping industry but which he said hurts farmers.     "Cargo preference is a costly special interest operated at the expense of American farmers and dockworkers," Lugar said in signing on as a co-sponsor or cargo preference repeal legislation.     The law requires shipment of U.S. goods on American ships rather than foreign vessels which are less costly.  Reuter &#3;

grain,corn,soybean,oilseed	BIG U.S. CONSERVATION ENROLLMENT EXPECTED .  Enrollment in the U.S. Agriculture Department's fourth conservation signup is expected to be announced tomorrow, and USDA officials said the figure may be higher than total enrollment for the first three signups.     Enrollment will be in the range of seven to 12 mln acres, USDA conservation specialists said. Total enrollment so far in the 10-year conservation program is 8.9 mln acres.     Producers submitted bids to enter 11 to 12 mln acres into the program, Milton Hertz, administrator for USDA's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service said at a congressional hearing yesterday. Not all the bids will be accepted, Hertz said, but enrollment is expected to be high.     As in the first three signups, the Great Plains area is expected to attract the greatest enrollment.     "The Great Plains area will be the predominate area which we'll get signup in," a USDA conservation specialist said.     Marginal corn acreage will likely be the bulk of the acreage pulled from that area, he said.     Fringe soybean acres in the southeast and some bean acreage in the midwest are also expected to be taken out of production, but the USDA source said this would be a relatively small percent of the total.     A special two dlr bonus to corn producers who enroll part of their corn base acreage into the program has sparked more interest in this latest signup, USDA officials said.     Under the program, USDA pays farmers annual rents to take land out of production for 10 years. The average rent payment accepted in the first three signups was 43.50 dlrs per acre.  Reuter &#3;

In its weekly petroleum status report, the Department of Energy agency said gasoline stocks were off 500,000 barrels in the week to 251.0 mln barrels and refinery crude oil stocks fell 1.2 mln barrels to 331.8 mln.     The EIA said residual fuel stocks fell 1.5 mln barrels to 36.4 mln barrels and crude oil stocks in the Strategic Petroleum Reserve (SPR) rose 200,000 barrels to 516.7 mln.     The total of all crude, refined product and SPR stocks fell 10.3 mln barrels to 1,564.8, it said.  Reuter &#3;
grain,corn,sorghum,sunseed,oilseed	MORE HEAVY RAINS IN ARGENTINE GRAIN AREAS .  Heavy rains fell again in Argentina's main grain growing areas in the week to yesterday, trade sources said.     Rains fell heaviest early in the week, and in particularly high volume in Buenos Aires province, Cordoba, La Pampa and Santa Fe provinces.     Rainfall totalled between 20 and 290 mm in Buenos Aires, heaviest in western sectors of the province, 20 to 145 mm in La Pampa, 25 to 120 mm in Cordoba, and 10 to 75 mm in Santa Fe. Rainfall was lighter in other provinces.     Rainfall totalled from five to 50 mm in Corrientes, five to 31 mm in San Luis, five to 30 mm in Entre Rios, three to 20 mm in Misiones, 11 to 17 mm in Formosa and one to eight mm in Chaco.     Growers said it was still too early to tell whether the rains had damaged crops, though they said maize and sunflower crops may have suffered.     Harvesting of both those crops and sorghum was paralysed by the bad weather. For harvesting to resume as normal, the rains would have to stop long enough for the soil to dry and allow farm machinery to operate.     The rains caused flooding in western and northwestern Buenos Aires, as more than 750 mm have fallen in some areas there since February 23 while the annual average is 1,200 mm.     Flooded areas total between 1.2 and 1.5 mln hectares, Buenos Aires province governor Alejandro Armendariz said after flying over the flooded area.     Agriculture Secretary Ernesto Figueras said only 500,000 hectares of the area now flooded had been planted, and that 200,000 to 300,000 hectares could be lost. Growers said large parts of the flooded areas were not planted because they are low-lying and flood easily.     Trade sources said it was certain crops were damaged by the heavy rains but it was too early to tell the exact extent of the damage. They said it was likely rain combined with high winds uprooted many sunflower and maize plants.     The sunflower harvest moved forward in the centre and south of Cordoba and Santa Fe and got underway in a few isolated areas of northern Buenos Aires. Growers have harvested between 15 and 18 pct of total planted area, up from seven to nine pct a week ago.     Estimates of the total volume of the sunflower crop were revised downward in light of the bad weather.     Estimates for total crop ranged from 2.3 to 2.6 mln tonnes, down from 2.4 to 2.7 mln tonnes estimated last week and down 34.1 to 41.5 pct from last year's record harvest of 4.1 mln tonnes.     Maize harvesting also advanced, reaching between 13 and 15 pct of total planted area compared to seven to nine pct a week ago. The maize harvest is expected to total between 10 and 10.2 mln tonnes, down from the 10 to 10.4 mln tonnes estimated a week ago.     Last year's maize harvest totalled 12.8 mln tonnes, according to official figures.     Soybean production estimates were revised downward, to 7.8 to 8.2 mln tonnes compared to estimates of eight to 8.4 mln tonnes a week ago. Last year's soybean harvest totalled 7.1 mln tonnes, according to official figures.     Sorghum harvesting moved slowly forward, reaching between four and six pct of total planted area, compared to two to four pct a week ago.     Sorghum production estimates remained steady at 3.2 to 3.5 mln tonnes, down 16.7 to 22 pct from the 4.1 to 4.2 mln tonnes produced in the last harvest.  Reuter &#3;
interest	PHILIPPINE DEBT TALKS DELAYED FOR CONSULTATIONS .  Today's debt rescheduling talks between the Philippines government and its bank advisory committee were postponed until Thursday to give the banks more time to consider Manila's novel proposal for paying part of its interest bill in notes instead of cash, bankers said.     The committee banks met briefly earlier today and decided that they needed more time in particular to consider a news report which quoted a Reagan Administration official as urging that the proposal be given serious consideration.     "The banks felt that this was new information and that further consultation was called for," one banker said.         In a despatch yesterday from Washington, Reuters quoted the official as saying Manila's plan to pay some interest with notes that could be converted into equity investments in the Philippines was fully consistent with the Reagan Administration strategy for handling developing country debt.     "The Philippine proposal is very interesting, it's quite unique and I don't think it's something that should be categorically rejected out of hand," the official said.     Because of the key role the U.S. plays in the debt crisis, foreign banks in particular wanted time to analyze the significance of the policymaker's comments, bankers said.  Reuter &#3;
acq	HUGHES &lt;HT> APPROVES MERGER WITH BAKER &lt;BKO> .  An overwhelming majority of Hughes Tool Co shareholders approved a merger agreement with Baker International Corp based on revised terms that allow the companies additional time to sell a drilling bit business as required by the U.S. Justice Department.      Hughes chairman William Kistler said the revised terms of the proposed consent decree also set a 10 mln dlr cap on how much funding the newly combined companies will have to spend on the disputed drilling bit business until it is sold.     An earlier proposed consent decree did not establish a funding limit.     The Baker-Hughes merger, which would would create a 1.2 billion dlr oilfield services company, almost fell through earlier this month when Hughes balked at terms of a proposed Justice Department consent decree that would have given the companies only three months to find a buyer for the Reed business.     Baker said today it would withdraw the one billion dlr lawsuit it had filed to force Hughes to follow through with the merger.     Hughes' Kistler, speaking to reporters after 85 pct of Hughes' shareholders approved the merger, said the revised terms of the agreement give the companies six months to find a buyer for the Reed drilling bit business. The previous agreement had proposed a three-month period.     Kistler said the the government had also indicated it would consider granting, if necessary, an additional three-month extension to complete the sale.     He said there were "several people looking" at the domestic drilling bit business.     The companies, Kistler said, have also decided to voluntarily sell a Reed plant in Singapore.     Kistler estimated that the merger, which should be completed in about two weeks, will result in annual cost savings of about 50 mln dlrs. He said he expects "substantial cutbacks" in the 20,000-member workforce at Baker-Hughes Inc, the name the merged company will take.     Kistler said the cost savings and greater efficiencies should put the company on a profitable course. "We think that in the third or fourth quarter after the merger we should see something close to breakeven," he said.     In the fourth quarter of 1986, Hughes earned 31.7 mln dlrs on sales of 215.7 mln dlrs.     Baker, in its first fiscal quarter ended December 31, lost 34.2 mln dlrs on revenues of 297.7 mln dlrs.
